About us Our history The Bromley Trust was set up by Toby Bromley in 1989 to help offset ‘man’s inhumanity to man’. Since its establishment it has provided numerous charities with grants to support their work on human rights, prison reform, or environmental issues. The specific funding priorities have been regularly reviewed by the Trustees, who have carefully sought to maximise the impact of the money spent. After Toby’s death, the Trustees set up a number of special awards in his memory. The Bromley Trust funds UK charities through two open grant programmes: Our funding priorities within these two programmes are regularly reviewed.
