Get Support Eligibility for Applying Grant programmes SMALL GRANT These grants are for smaller charities whose annual income is between £25,000 and £500,000, according to the latest published accounts. Small grants are unrestricted and do not have to be used on a specific purpose. Small grants range from £1,000 – £5,000 per year, for up to three years The total amount of the grant requested must not exceed 20 per cent of the total income of the charity, averaged over the past two years. LARGE GRANT These grants are for larger charities whose annual income is between £500,000 and £5 million, according to the latest published accounts. Large grants are restricted for specific projects with defined goals and budgets, and may be spent on, for example, salaries, equipment, training, monitoring and administration. Large grants usually range from £10,000 to £60,000 in total spread over one to three years.

We will consider one year grants only in exceptional circumstances such as for pilot projects.
