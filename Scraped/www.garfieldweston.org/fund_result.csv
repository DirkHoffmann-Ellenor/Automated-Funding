Must be a registered charity with at least one year of accounts. Grants typically cover up to 10% of total project cost; half of project funding should be secured before applying.,Possibly Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity providing palliative and end-of-life care in Kent, which matches the applicant type and geographic scope. The Foundation funds health and palliative care projects, and hospices are specifically referenced. However, the Garfield Weston Foundation explicitly states: 'We focus our support for hospices on major capital developments, or discrete projects such as piloting new services. If however a piloted service becomes part of your main operation, we would be unlikely to fund its continuation. We do not fund operating/core costs for hospices.' This means ellenor Hospice is not eligible for core cost funding, but could apply for a major capital project or a new pilot project. Funding range is suitable, and applications are rolling. Restrictions on core cost funding for hospices are a significant limitation. Therefore, eligibility is 'Possibly Eligible'—ellenor Hospice may apply if seeking funding for a major capital or pilot project, but not for ongoing or core costs.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:38:51,
