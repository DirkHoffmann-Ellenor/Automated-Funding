Our next application deadline will be 17 March 2025. Find out more about our strategy here . Our approach The Bromley Trust is an independent grant-making Trust. We fund specialist charities that are helping to bring about positive social change through their work with marginalised people in the justice system or people who need human rights protection in the UK. We also support and connect our grantees with those who can help them achieve their aims and our collective vision of a society that treats people humanely and respects their human rights and dignity. We have two open grant programmes, Human Rights and Prison Reform , and are only able to accept applications for funding which fit within these. Our grant spend is in the region of £1m per year. We make grants ranging from £15,000 to £30,000 per year to specialist charities with an annual income of between £100,000 and £1.2m. We prefer to provide multi-year funding and like to develop close relationships with our grantees so we can provide support and help them to achieve their aims. We give unrestricted grants. We believe this is the most useful type of funding for the charities we support as it offers flexibility and allows them to adapt as situations and priorities change. We believe in the value of collaboration and encourage those we support to work with other organisations with similar aims wherever possible. We seek to operate transparently. We use cookies.
