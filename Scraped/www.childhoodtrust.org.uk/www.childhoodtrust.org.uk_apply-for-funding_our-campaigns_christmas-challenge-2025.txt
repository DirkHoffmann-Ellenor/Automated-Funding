Christmas Challenge 2025 Applications Closed The Big Give’s Christmas Challenge is the UK’s largest collaborative fundraising campaign, and we're proud to support it once again as a Champion Funder. This year’s campaign will run from 2nd to 9th December 2025 , offering London-based charities that support children living in poverty the opportunity to have their donations doubled through matched funding. In 2024, the campaign raised an incredible £6 million for 113 charities, helping over 185,000 children living in poverty across the capital and of course, we want to beat that again this year.
