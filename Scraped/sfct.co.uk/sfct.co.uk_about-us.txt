About Us The Steinberg Family Charitable Trust is registered as a charity with the Charities Commission under charity number 1045231. The Trust was established by an initial loan from The Late Lord Steinberg and has since received further donations and legacies from the family. The work of the trust is a tribute to the philanthropic ideals o f its Founder who passed away in 2009 and his wife Lady B eryl Steinberg who passed away in 2022. The Trust is a grant making entity, does not fund-raise and seeks to ensure a lasting legacy through careful management of its resources and distribution of its funds. The Steinberg family hold two Trustee positions – 1) Lynne Bloch, the Founder’s daughter and 3) Jonathan Steinberg, the Founder’s son. The objects of the Trust are to use the income as the Trustees’ see fit in making donations for charitable purposes. Whilst the objects in the founding deed are very wide, the main aim of the Steinberg Family Charitable Trust is the provision of grants to Jewish charities located in the North West of the United Kingdom or active within the Jewish Community whether in the North West or Israel, particularly those involved with the provision of education, and social services. Whilst most of our grants are to Jewish Charities, we do make grants to non-Jewish organisations and similarly whilst we seek to make most of our grants in the North West of the UK, we do make grants outside of this area
