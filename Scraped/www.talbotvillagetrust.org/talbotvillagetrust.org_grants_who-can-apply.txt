Sign up for our newsletter to receive the latest updates on funding, events we are hosting or supporting, estate related news, and more! Who can apply? We support charities, faith-based groups, schools, universities and non-profits. Our area of benefit Our mission is to help people living and working across South East Dorset, and our funding and activity is geographically restricted - our Area of Benefit (AoB). Organisations applying to us for funding will need to be based within this area and / or must be able to demonstrate that their work has impact for people living and working here. We fund activities that benefit people living in our Area of Benefit, even if your organisational headquarters is based elsewhere. If your project also operates outside of our Area of Benefit, you may only apply for the proportion of the project that takes place within our designated area. Before applying, please review the questions on our FAQ page . To arrange a discussion about your ideas for an application, please contact our Grants department at info@talbotvillagetrust.org and a member of the team will be happy to advise you further.
