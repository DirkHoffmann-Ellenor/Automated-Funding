Champions for Children 2025 Campaign Breakdown This year, 86 of our incredible charity partners came together through our Champions for Children 2025 match-funding campaign to raise over £4.4 million for vulnerable children across London. Nearly £1 million of this total was matched funding from us at The Childhood Trust, with the vast majority of partners unlocking 100% of their pledged matched funds – an outstanding achievement that reflects the dedication and commitment of everyone involved. While the numbers are impressive, for us this campaign is about much more than fundraising. It’s about partnership, trust, and shared purpose. We’re proud to support our charity partners at every stage, from our Get Campaign Ready event, through the live campaign, and into post-campaign reflection and impact reporting. Hosting this annual campaign on the Big Give platform, we’re continually inspired by the creativity, compassion, and tireless energy of the organisations we work with. The funds raised will have a tangible impact, providing vital support, safe spaces, and opportunities to thousands of children experiencing poverty. To all of our charity partners, donors, and supporters, thank you. Your hard work and generosity ensure this campaign can continue to be an enormous success each year, and we're so proud to champion our partners. Together, we’re creating lasting change. Here’s to another phenomenal year of being champions for London's children. This website uses cookies to improve your experience. We'll assume you're ok with this, but you can opt-out if you wish.
