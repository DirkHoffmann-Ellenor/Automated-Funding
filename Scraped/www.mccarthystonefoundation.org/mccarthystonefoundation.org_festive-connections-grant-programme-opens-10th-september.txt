News & Events Enjoy our selection of true stories Festive Connections Grant Programme – Opens 10th September We’re pleased to announce that the McCarthy Stone Foundation is awarding grants of up to £750 to support over 30 charitable organisations to provide festive celebrations for the over 65’s in the most deprived parts of the country. December can be a diﬃcult time of year for so many older people who might not be surrounded by family and friends. We are looking to fund initiatives that will help to provide some social connection or let people know they are not forgotten about during the festive period. Grant applications open on 10th September, 2025, and close on 3rd October 2025 at 5pm. You can learn more here We look forward to reading your wonderful festive applications.
