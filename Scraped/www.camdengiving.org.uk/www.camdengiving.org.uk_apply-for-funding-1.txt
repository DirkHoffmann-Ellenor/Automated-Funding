Our Grants If you are awarded a grant by Camden Giving, then a panel of Camden citizens with personal experience of inequality, have decided that your work is what’s needed in our borough. In partnership with Camden Citizens and Camden Council, the We Make Camden Kit gives grants of up to £2,000 to citizens, small organisations and schools who have great ideas. Successful grantees can also now return for a larger Growth Grant of up to £5,000. Open for applications on a rolling basis. Aimed at addressing inequalities faced by young people and families, women, people of colour, disabled people, and care leavers. In Camden, these are the people being disproportionately impacted by poverty, isolation, and hate. Applications are currently closed. We strongly advise that you get in touch before making an application to talk through the criteria for funding. You can do this by booking an appointment and/ or emailing admin@camdengiving.org.uk. Even if you don’t think we can fund your work right now, please meet us for a coffee or come to a drop-in, we are quickly developing our grants and we’d love to hear about your ideas. Past Funds A panel by young people for young people. Our ‘Future Changemakers Fund’ ran for 4 years and aimed to address inequality experienced by young people in Camden.
