This means the data is freely accessible to anyone to be used and shared as they wish. The data must be attributed to Cheshire Community Foundation. Open data is defined as data and content that can be freely used, modified and shared by anyone for any purpose. Quite often, open datasets are made available to the public for the first time. Previously, they could have been locked away with special access rights or needed certain knowhow. In some cases the information might already exist as word documents or PDFs, for example. The difference with open data is that it is published in “data formats” (such as spreadsheets) that make it easier for people to access, analyse and – sometimes – mix with other datasets. Open data is linked to many of the issues that are key to the sector – transparency, accountability and openness. Open data can assist VCS organisations to access insights and information that may have previously been out of reach. That our data is useful We wish to publish data that will bring value to those building a stronger community and voluntary sector. That our data is meaningful We wish to publish data that add to the ongoing dialogue and discussion about the sector. That our data are accessible We wish to publish data in an open accessible way, and provide regular narrative and understanding to our stakeholders. In this context, Cheshire Community Foundation aims to operate an open data policy that is robust and practical, leading to greater engagement in the issues faced by the community and voluntary sectors in Cheshire and Warrington. Our Open Data Policy explains what open data is, why we are releasing the data, our goals, commitments, principles and practices, how you can use our open data and our Code of Conduct when using the data. [link to policy currently unavailable; contact us for a copy] Cheshire Community Foundation encourages others to access, use and discuss our open data. We strive towards a strong community and voluntary sector in Cheshire, Warrington and more broadly across the UK, and value the contributions and insights that can be gleaned through use of data.
