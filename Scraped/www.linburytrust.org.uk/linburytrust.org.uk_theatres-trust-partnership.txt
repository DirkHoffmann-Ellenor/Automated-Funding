We are working in partnership with the Theatres Trust, the national public advisory body for theatres, on a new grants programme. This scheme will provide grants of up to £5,000 for essential works to enable not-for-profit theatres across the UK to be viable and to thrive. The grants will support small projects that make a big impact to a theatre’s resilience, sustainability or accessibility. We want theatres to reopen with confidence and creativity, and these grants for focused capital work – such as access improvements, installation of key plant and machinery and works to make theatre buildings digital-ready – will help to welcome back a wide range of audiences.
