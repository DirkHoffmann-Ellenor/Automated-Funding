Grants Awarded We work in partnership with our donors to fund a range of needs and themes, including mental ill-health, sport, young people, the environment, arts, disadvantaged individuals looking for help into training and employment and much more. We are incredibly proud to support so many vital groups across Surrey, who work hard to make our community a better place. Grant awards FY 2024-25: £2.8m We've made adjustments to our process for shortlisting Expressions of Interest (EOIs) to better align with the available funding. This has led to a higher success rate, with an average of 81% of full applications receiving a grant . While this streamlines the process and saves time for both applicants and staff, it doesn't change the fact that available funding still falls short of demand. Our recent survey highlights the ongoing challenges: 86% of applicants and grant holders are worried about raising funds , with 41% being very concerned. Additionally, nearly half of respondents reported a significant increase in demand for their services. Area Funds The number of small grants awarded has grown substantially in the last two years as our family of Area Funds are engaging with local people to award small grants to grassroots groups. Small grants up to £2,500 can be awarded by the local panels on a rolling basis and a fast turnaround.
