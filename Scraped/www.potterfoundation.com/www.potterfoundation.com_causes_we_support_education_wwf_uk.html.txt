We have supported two WWF projects: Tanzania Environmental Education Programme (TEEP) TEEP puts the environment at the centre of Tanzanian education and promotes good environmental practice throughout communities. TEEP’s external evaluation found that it had a significant, lasting legacy on environmental practice in Tanzania. Projects included: developing regional environmental education programmes; putting ‘greening’ programmes into all teachers’ colleges and selected primary schools and communities â for example carrying out practical work on soil erosion control, composting, establishing tree nurseries and vegetable gardens; and publishing resources for pupils and teachers. Climate Solutions: WWF’s Vision for 2050 This key publication was the culmination of a major piece of scientific research which informs WWFâs policy and campaigning around the world. A team of global experts carried out extensive research into energy use over the next 50 years to form a scientifically based position on energy issues. The research looked at how energy needs can be met without further compromising the environment, and assessed the relative merits of alternative energy options. WWF are using this in future discussions and when making recommendations on climate change and energy. Images Further information Climate Solutions: WWF’s Vision for 2050 wwf.org.uk panda.org
