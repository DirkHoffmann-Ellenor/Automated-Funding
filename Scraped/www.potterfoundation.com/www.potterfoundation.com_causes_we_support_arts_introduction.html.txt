Home About the Foundation Who we are Causes we support Introduction Education Civil Society Non-Strategic Past Giving Introduction Education Civil Society Non-Strategic Past Giving Grant recipients Apply for funding Non-Strategic A small amount of our annual spend is dedicated to supporting causes close to the personal interests of the Potter family that are outside of the two main areas of focus. This includes our long standing support of the arts. We believe that the performing arts contribute to a strong society and to quality of life in general, enhancing individual understanding and promoting independent thought. We support a number of London based theatres and one arts organisation in New York City.
