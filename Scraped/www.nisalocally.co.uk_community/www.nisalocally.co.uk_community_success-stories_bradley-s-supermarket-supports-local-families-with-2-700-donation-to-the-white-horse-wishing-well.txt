The foundation, set up by The White Horse pub in Quorn, is dedicated to raising money for local causes and continues to make a real difference to people in the area. The donation was made possible through Making a Difference Locally (MADL), a charity that allows independently owned Co-op Wholesale affiliated stores to support good causes in their communities. Funds are raised through the sale of Co-op own-brand products in store, with a percentage going into a virtual fund for each retailer to donate locally. Jack Matthews, Partner at Bradley’s Supermarket, said: “We’ve supported hundreds of local causes through MADL over the years, but The White Horse Wishing Well stands out as an extraordinary example of community spirit. The team work tirelessly to raise money for families who need a helping hand, and we’re incredibly proud to contribute to their ongoing impact.” This latest donation takes the total raised by Bradley’s Supermarket through MADL to over £115,000 – a significant milestone in its mission to give back to the local community. Kate Carroll, Social Value Lead at Co-op Wholesale, added: “The White Horse Wishing Well is exactly the kind of grassroots cause MADL was created to support. Thanks to the ongoing commitment of stores like Bradley’s, we’re able to invest in initiatives that bring real benefit to local people. It’s a brilliant example of a retailer and a community coming together to make a difference.” Facebook Link Twitter Link Pinterest Link LinkedIn Link
