#one in six Our work so far The Prudence Trust is a young foundation. Over our first years we have met hundreds of inspiring charities and researchers in the youth mental health sector. Those people and their organisations have shaped us and our funding. Here is a snapshot of what we have been up to. For more detail on our individual grants, please visit the Our Impact page. We launched the Prudence Trust Fellowship Scheme to build the field of adolescent mental health research. We awarded fellowship grants to four universities, supporting mental health researchers to understand what works in preventing or treating young people’s mental health. Continuing our commitment, we have just awarded a second set of four research fellowship grants to the four universities, looking to support youth mental health researchers. Three universities have also received funding to explore research projects into what works in mental health services. We are interested in the role of non-clinical activities in helping young people with early symptoms of anxiety and depression. We are supporting eight organisations to deliver an exciting range of “social prescribing” activities, from music to surfing. As well as enabling the delivery of these projects, our funding is also helping to increase the sustainability of these activities. We want to encourage young people to seek early effective help. We awarded a grant to Place2Be to support Children’s Mental Health Week 2023 and to Student Minds, to support University Mental Health Day . Through our first open round of funding, we awarded grants to five organisations to increase their capacity to directly support young people struggling with anxiety and depression. This was open to organisations operating online or in greater London. Recognising the increasing pressure that youth workers are facing and their important role in caring for young people experiencing poor mental health, we awarded grants to two youth organisations to support those doing this vital work. We are committed to being as transparent as possible. We work with the 360Giving Initiative to publish our grant data using the 360Giving data standard.
