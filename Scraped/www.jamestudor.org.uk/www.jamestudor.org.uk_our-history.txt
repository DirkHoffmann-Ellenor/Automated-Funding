James Tudor (1880 –1952) was Honorary Secretary of The Bristol Medical Institutions Contributory Scheme from its inception in 1926. This organisation was established to help address the financial crisis faced by the Voluntary Hospitals through regular contributions from working people who, in return, would have access to hospital treatment without charge. In 1935, this scheme was extended under the name of Bristol Contributory Scheme Welfare Association (later BCWA) with James Tudor as its chairman. His son-in-law, Geoffrey Wren, became Secretary of BCWA in 1936 and served 40 years until his retirement, when he handed the baton to his elder son Martin. Under Martin Wren’s leadership, the Association went from strength to strength, eventually becoming the UK’s fourth largest Provident Association. The proceeds of the sale of BCWA in 2004 – some £26m – were transferred to the newly established charity, The James Tudor Foundation, of which Martin Wren was chairman until his death in 2016.
