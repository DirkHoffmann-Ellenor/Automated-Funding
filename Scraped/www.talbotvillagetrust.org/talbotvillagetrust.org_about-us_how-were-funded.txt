How weâ€™re funded We raise our funds through capital left in trust by the Talbot sisters in 1885, as well as land and property connected to our historic estate. Our grant-giving capital funding is made possible through a legacy left by our founders, Georgina and Mary Anne Talbot. The Trust derives its income from land and property connected to our historic estate, as well as capital raised through an endowment investment fund. We are fortunate to be able to fund all of our charitable giving through this means. Carefully considered development proposals on our land assets intend to provide further funding to enhance grant-giving. The Talbot Quarter, as identified in the Poole Local Plan (2018) is a scheme to create a new hospital and Innovation Park at land to the south of Talbot Campus, home to Bournemouth University and Arts University Bournemouth. The plans aim to enhance healthcare provision in the local area, while also providing a start-up and grow-on space for technological innovation and emerging creative industries. You can read more about the proposals here. Discover more Our history Receiving an inheritance from the father, two Victorian sisters decided to use their wealth to help others.
