More than £2 million awarded to create active spaces in London Wide range of activities funded, from environmentally friendly ‘plogging’ to playground improvements It's been a little over six months since we launched our Active Spaces Fund, and in that time we've awarded more than £2.4 million to improve and create places, spaces and facilities in London to support children, young people and marginalised groups and communities to lead active and healthy lives. A total of 81 projects across 26 London Boroughs have been funded, covering a wide range of sports and physical activities – from dance to fencing to volleyball – for different communities. This includes an environmentally friendly ‘plogging’ project (combining jogging and litter picking), six new play projects for children and families, an Inclusive Cycling Centre in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park for people with disabilities, new safe and accessible fitness sessions for LGBTQIA+ people, and free boxing sessions for Muslim and Black women. With physical and mental health ranked as the third most important issue for young Londoners ( Partnership for Young London’s Levelling up London Report , 2023), and the continuing uncertainty of the cost-of-living crisis disproportionately impacting marginalised groups and communities, our mission to create opportunities for more children, young people, marginalised groups and communities to lead active and healthy lives has never been more important. Catherine Anderson, Executive Director of the London Marathon Foundation , said: “Our mission to increase and diversify participation in physical activity is more important than ever and we want to support as many people as we can to lead active and healthy lives. “The wide range of groups and organisations we are supporting through our Active Spaces Fund are truly inspiring and their innovative ideas and passion will create new opportunities for children, young people and marginalised groups to be active. By working together, we can develop healthier and happier communities across London.” Chris Broadbent, Founder and CEO of Planet Earth Games Trust , said: “We are thrilled to have secured funding from the London Marathon Foundation to launch three community plogging groups in the capital, combining our charity’s mission of supporting physical activity and taking climate action. We look forward to working with people within London communities to support shared wellbeing and improving their shared environments through this exciting programme.” Zoe Portlock, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Bikeworks , said: “We’re so excited our new Inclusive Cycling Centre will be opening on 20 April, thanks to the support of the London Marathon Foundation. The first of its kind in London, our Inclusive Cycling Centre will provide disabled people with even more cycling experiences and showcase the benefits of cycling for everyone." Bisila Noha, Business Development Manager at the London LGBTQ+ Community Centre , said: “We’re chuffed to be funded by the London Marathon Foundation! By creating a new LGBTQ+ space with a broad range of physical activities, we will be supporting our mission to improve our community’s wellbeing as well as providing opportunities for less experienced LGBTQ+ fitness facilitators and teachers to start up their careers.” Julie Quinn, Mulberry Macmillan Cancer Information and Support Services Manager at The Mulberry Centre , said: “We are delighted to receive this funding to better support people affected by cancer by running low-weight exercise sessions aimed at maintaining muscle tone and strength – also providing a great opportunity to meet up and share experiences with others who may be going through similar circumstances while being active.” Giles Hobart, Chief Executive of TAG Youth Club for Disabled Young People , said: “Our aim of providing children and young people with additional needs the opportunity to explore sports and activities they wouldn’t usually be able to take part in is becoming a reality, thanks to this funding – ensuring the right equipment is in place and spaces are safe for attendees to participate in.” About the funded projects: London Borough of Barking & Dagenham • The Disablement Association of Barking
