Whilst we remain committed to those children we currently support in schools, Buttle UK are no longer supporting new applications. If you are seeking support for a young person for boarding school fees, other potential sources of funding can be found at the Educational Trusts Forum – https://educational-grants.org/ You may also wish to check with the boarding school your child attends, or wishes to attend, to see if it has an existing bursary scheme.
