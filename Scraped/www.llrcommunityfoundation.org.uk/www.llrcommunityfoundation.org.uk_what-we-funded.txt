Modern Philanthropy in Action Modern Philanthropy in Action These 5-minute films feature the work of each of the local charitable groups supported by the Women in Philanthropy Fund between 2010 and 2019. They were made by the Community Foundation and De Montfort University, shown at an annual screening hosted by Curve with Women in Philanthropy, then given to the groups to promote and support their work.
