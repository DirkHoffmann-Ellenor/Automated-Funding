Wolfson Jewish Education Fund The Wolfson Jewish Education Fund (WJEF) has been established by the great-grandchildren of Sir Isaac and Lady Edith Wolfson – the fourth generation of the Wolfson family to be involved in philanthropy since the Wolfson Family Charitable Trust was established in 1958. WJEF is not directly connected to the Wolfson Family Charitable Trust, and is separately administered. The WJEF does not accept speculative applications, and all enquiries should be directed in the first instance to: Anna Josse, Prism the Gift Fund, 20 Gloucester Place, London W1U 8HA.
