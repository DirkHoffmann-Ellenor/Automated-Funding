Frequently Asked Questions To manage our resources effectively, we do not accept unsolicited applications. We meet and get to know excellent organisations and individuals first, and we invite applications from those that align best with our strategy . If you support disadvantaged young people and meet our eligibility criteria, we’ll be glad to get to know you. Until now, we have only funded organisations. However, we are actively exploring the possibility of extending our funding to individuals who are connected to organisations working with disadvantaged young people. We will make a public update when we are ready to do this. The Foundation was established in 1965 by Joseph Levy who was a key figure in London’s regeneration after the Second World War. Lawrence Levy, Joseph’s youngest son, was a successful sports photographer and he set up his own charitable trust – following Lawrence’s death in 1995, the Lawrence Levy Charitable Trust was merged with the Joseph Levy Foundation. The Foundation has an endowment (currently valued at £22m) which is invested to generate a return, which is used to fund grants and operational costs. We are a registered charity. The Executive Director, staff team, and Board of Trustees meet regularly to set the overall strategic direction. Our experienced staff team lead the operations that deliver on the strategy. Our Board is made up of 6 trustees, 4 of which are members of the Levy family. We know that making a meaningful difference goes beyond grant-making – financial support alone is not enough . We are currently exploring different ways that make best use of our available resources. This includes building partnerships with organisations that share our ambition to support disadvantaged young people. It also includes recruiting a Young Advisory Board to help guide our decision-making. We will be making public updates soon.
