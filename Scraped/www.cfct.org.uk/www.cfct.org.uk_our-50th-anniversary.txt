Sir James was an extremely modest man who never sought profile or publicity for his philanthropy, but through the work of the Trust his name lives on as a fitting and permanent memorial to his generosity and philanthropy. In our fiftieth year, we celebrated Sir James’s life by funding a range of projects and hosting a series of events. The year began with the launch of our successful Kent Fixers project, an initiative that celebrated the voice of Kent’s young people. 30 young people were given the opportunity to create resources, including videos, to raise awareness about issues that were important to them with the objective of letting young people make a meaningful, positive difference to the lives of other young people. The Trust then made a significant gift of land to ellenor hospice. Over the summer months the trustees reviewed a series of major grant proposals and made flagship grants in the autumn which will serve as memorials to Sir James’ legacy. To end the year, the Trust held a prestigious awards event, celebrating and rewarding some of the best charities it had funded in the last decade. Colyer-Fergusson Charity Awards 2019 – celebrating the Trust’s 50th anniversary On 7 November 2019 we hosted the Colyer-Fergusson Charity Awards at Shakespeare’s Underglobe on London’s South Bank. It was a fantastic opportunity to recognise and reward some of Kent’s most outstanding charities and community groups. The awards gave us the opportunity to thank organisations that the Trust has funded and show them how much we appreciate what they do. After all, it is only through their hard work and dedication that Colyer-Fergusson’s funds have made a lasting positive difference to some of the most disadvantaged and marginalised young people in Kent.
