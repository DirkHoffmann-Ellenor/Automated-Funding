Education Awards Lunch 2025 Last week, on Tuesday 29th April, we held our Education Awards Lunch. Master Hugh Wolley, Wardens Helen Whelan and Mark Boult, and other Company members welcomed 46 Tallow Chandler Award Winners and staff to Tallow Chandlers' Hall. Joining us were Award Winners from The University of Manchester; University of East London; Selwyn College, University of Cambridge; Snow Camp; City of London School for Girls; City of London School; and the Company’s three flagship schools, Greig City Academy; The Leigh Academy Halley; and Cubitt Town Primary School. Our guest speaker was Tim Gargan, Global Medical Officer with the HALO Trust, and a Tallow Chandler Past Award Winner and (now) Associate Member, who gave an inspirational and thought-provoking speech. This annual event is held to congratulate our award winners on their achievements, and for them to find out more about the Company and meet members. All of the Company’s Award Winners become Past Award Winners, and many go on to join the Company. Back to the Top
