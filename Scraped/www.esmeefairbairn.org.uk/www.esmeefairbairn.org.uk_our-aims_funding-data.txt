Zoielogic Dance Theatre We believe in the potential of open data. With better information, funders can be more effective and strategic decision-makers. We also believe that being transparent helps us to be accountable. On average, our active portfolio contains over 700 grants. We have published all our grants and social investments made since 2008 on 360Giving , an initiative that aims to help UK funders publish their data in an open and standard format online. By publishing our data in an open format through 360Giving, it can be shared and compared more easily.
