What we fund 1) Evidence-based physical therapies for any of the groups below: People living with degenerative physical conditions People living with physical disabilities People recovering from life-changing injuries These charities provide therapies such as physiotherapy, hydrotherapy, multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes, etc. We prioritise charities that provide these services free of charge or at highly subsidised prices. Common reasons for ineligibility in this category : Charities without a specialist focus on the above and instead serving a broad range of clients including individuals not affected by degenerative physical conditions, disability, or life-changing injuries. Ineligible charities may also be mainly providing complementary physical therapies such as osteopathy or chiropractic therapy, or other therapies which are not evidence-based or routinely prescribed by the NHS. 2) Specialist, single-condition charities Typically, these are national charities that provide information about a specific condition via nurse-led helplines and via digital and print materials. In this category, we prioritise charities that are members of the Patient Information Forum (PIF) and/or hold PIF Tick certification . Similarly, charities operating helplines are given preference if they are members of the Helplines Partnership or hold the Helplines Standard certification. Common reasons for ineligibility in this category : Charities with a broad focus on several conditions; or Charities mainly providing peer support; practical support such as non-nursing personal care, transport; leisure activities / social hubs; rather than specialist information and support for patients with a specific condition. 3) Charities that provide direct healthcare services to marginalised communities Under this category we only support charities whose sole focus is to provide direct healthcare to marginalised communities. Exceptionally, if funds allow, we may consider applications from homelessness charities with already established mobile healthcare clinics.
