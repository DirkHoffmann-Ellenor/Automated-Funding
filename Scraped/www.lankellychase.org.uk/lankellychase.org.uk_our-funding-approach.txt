Our funding approach Lankelly Chase is focused on justice, not charity and this shapes our funding approach. We are trying to fund differently. If you’re trying to be different too, read on. We seek UK-based partners who are working to reveal, question and dismantle or heal, reimagine and transform systems. No one person has the answer for changing whole systems, so we inquire into it by creating mutual learning relationships from which we can all benefit. What happens during the partnership is more important to us than an initial proposal. We emphasise learning and communicating with you as we’re interested in sharing what is emerging from your work with others. We will always strive for transparency in our decisions and processes. If you would like it, we will give feedback on your application.
