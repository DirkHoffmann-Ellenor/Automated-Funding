UK Small Grants Thank you for your interest in our UK Small Grants programme. This programme is designed to support excellent local organisations and projects that work with: disabled children and young people; children and young people with life-limiting conditions; and their families. It provides grants of up to Â£10,000, although many grants are smaller than this. The programme is open to applications at any time. We aim to respond to your application with a final decision within twelve weeks.Â We aim to support as many organisations as possible, and therefore are unlikely to fund any organisation in consecutive years. If you have received a grant, please wait at least a year after the completion of your project before reapplying. If you are unsuccessful, we also ask that you wait at least one year from the date of your application before reapplying. Guidelines Thank you for your interest in our UK Small Grants programme.
