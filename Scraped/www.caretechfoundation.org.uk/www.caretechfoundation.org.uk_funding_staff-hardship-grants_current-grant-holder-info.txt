Current Grant Holder Information Our team will contact you with next steps in your award confirmation email, please ensure that you respond to this with the requested information. Once we have payment details, we can arrange payment â€“ this will normally take two weeks from when we receive payment details for the payment to reach the designated account (we try and pay grants to suppliers such as landlords, funeral homes etc. where possible, but we may pay grants directly to you depending on circumstances and the purpose of the awarded grant). Please contact either the Grants and Finance Officer or email us at info@caretechfoundation.org.uk . Once the Board of Trustees has approved an award, we are unable to change the award except in exceptional circumstances. We are also unable to make more than one grant to each staff member in a twelve-month period. However, our team will do the best they can to signpost you to other organisations that may be able to help. The COVID SSP Fund is run by CareTech Holdings Limited, and is not run by the Foundation. Therefore, staff at the Foundation will not be able to answer any questions about the COVID SSP Fund. All enquiries regarding the COVID SSP Fund should be sent by email to CareTechCOVID19Fund@caretech-uk.com . Due to the volume of applications we receive, we are unable to process applications sooner than the timeframe given on our website. If your situation is time-sensitive, please let us know when you submit your application and we will do our best to keep that in mind. Please note that this fund takes several weeks to process applications and we cannot guarantee being able to process applications quicker than expected. We receive a very high volume of applications so we may occasionally experience delays when processing applications, but please note that we will always do our best to process your application as soon as we can.
