Open Grants Data Pears Foundation is committed to transparency and we work with 360Giving to publish information about our grants. Using the 360Giving data standard, our awarded grants are available as csv documents here. We believe that with better information, grantmakers can be more effective and strategic decision-makers. 360Giving provides support for grantmakers to publish their grants data openly, to understand their data, and to use the data to create online tools that make grant- making more effective.
