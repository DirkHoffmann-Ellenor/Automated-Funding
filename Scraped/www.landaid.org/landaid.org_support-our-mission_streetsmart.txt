Support our mission StreetSmart In this section LandAid is incredibly proud to continue to partner with StreetSmart as part of their campaign to help tackle homelessness. SleepSmart also works with hotels across the country to raise funds for people experiencing homelessness. In 2024 the campaign raised over £1 million! Nearly £700,000 of this will support youth specific homelessness charities. We are currently in the process of awarding these funds to charities across the country. You can also see the impact that previous funds have had right across the UK here. Are you a restaurant or hotel who would like to take part in the StreetSmart 2025 campaign? You, your diners and your guests can support people experiencing homelessness this winter. Want to support the StreetSmart 2025 campaign? Find a restaurant or hotel taking part near you
