Home Community Success Stories Making a Difference Locally launches ‘The Mindful Fund’ to support wellbeing in schools Making a Difference Locally launches ‘The Mindful Fund’ to support wellbeing in schools Co-op Wholesale’s charity, Making a Difference Locally (MADL), has today launched a brand-new funding initiative aimed at supporting wellbeing in schools. The Mindful Fund will provide £50,000 in total for Co-op Wholesale retail partners to apply for grants of £7 9 5 each, enabling them to support a nominated individual in a local school to receive Mindfulness training. The training will be delivered by the respected charity, the Mindfulness in Schools Project (MiSP). MiSP recommend that two teachers from every school sign up to make this approach sustainable. This training equips educators with the tools to deliver mindfulness techniques in the classroom, helping young people to better manage stress, regulate emotions, and build resilience – essential skills in today’s challenging world. The fund is open-ended and will remain available until all £50,000 has been allocated, which will enable 31 schools across the UK to benefit from this life-enhancing initiative. Kate Carroll, Social Value Lead at Co-op Wholesale, said: “We’re proud to be launching The Mindful Fund through our Making a Difference Locally charity. By investing in training for individuals within schools, we can create a ripple effect that supports the wellbeing of countless young people. "This fund not only empowers our partners to support their communities but also helps us take meaningful action to address the growing challenges faced by young people today.” Co-op Wholesale retailers are encouraged to apply soon to secure a place for a local school before the fund is fully utilised.
