Find out more Applications to the trust are reviewed quarterly. Quarterly cut offs are 30 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December each year. Given that the Trustees personally review a short list of applications and the timing of this can vary according to commitments, we do no notify or give feedback to unsuccessful applicants. If you have not had a response to an application within 6 months, then this should be taken that the application was unsuccessful.
