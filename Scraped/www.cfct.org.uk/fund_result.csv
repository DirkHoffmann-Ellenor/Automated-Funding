The Trust may offer some flexibility if income is 'slightly higher', but ellenor's income is far in excess of this. The Trust does not fund hospitals, health authorities, or medical care, but does fund local charities supporting vulnerable people, including those affected by bereavement and life-limiting conditions.",Not Eligible,"The Colyer-Fergusson Charitable Trust Community Fund is open to registered charities based in Kent, serving local communities, and supporting vulnerable people, which matches ellenor Hospice's profile. However, the explicit eligibility criteria state: 'Gross income in the last financial year must be £500,000 or less. If your income is slightly higher than this, please contact us as we may be able to offer some flexibility.' ellenor Hospice's annual income is £8.2M, which is more than 16 times the stated maximum and cannot reasonably be considered 'slightly higher.' There is no indication of a separate funding stream for larger charities, and the restrictions are clear. Therefore, ellenor Hospice is Not Eligible for the Community Fund. The Trust's other grant streams (Proactive, Thematic, Partner) are either invitation-only or not open for direct application.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:33:55,
