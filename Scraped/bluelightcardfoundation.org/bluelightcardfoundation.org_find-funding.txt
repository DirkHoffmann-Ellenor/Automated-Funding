To support the wellbeing of the Blue Light community, we fund projects that: Have health and wellbeing of staff and volunteers at their heart Build Resilience focusing on proactive, preventative measures Enable staff and volunteers to keep well Provide direct support to help people recover, manage, or live well We are particularly keen to receive applications for projects that support individuals across multiple Blue Light services, fostering collaboration and shared learning. Initiatives that include clear, well-developed plans for continuing the work beyond the life of the grant will also be prioritised. Foundation grants are offered up to a maximum of Â£25,000 . They can be towards running costs, projects, or equipment. The work can be new, continuing or a one-off initiative, but it must benefit current or former staff or volunteers within the Blue Light community with a sustainability plan post funding.
