Our June grants list: record core grants awarded! Published by Anna on 24 Jun 2024 The list of grants awarded at our June panel is now live on our website – and we are delighted that the Trust awarded its highest ever proportion of core funding grants. We know that core (which for us, usually means unrestricted) funding is so helpful to charities. We aim to provide it where we can and where it’s wanted by the applicant charity. As always, you can download a full list of grants made from our homepage , or explore the grants using this handy 360Giving widget: Photo credit cover image: Freepix Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest
