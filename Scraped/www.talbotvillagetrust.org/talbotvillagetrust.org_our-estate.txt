Our estate Shaped over decades, our land plays a vital role in our vision, supporting nature, enhancing wellbeing and helping local communities.

Housing Preserving character, appearance, and continuing the Talbot sisters’ legacy. Talbot Heath Talbot Heath is a protected heathland maintained by Talbot Village Trust and BCP Council. Proposed Talbot Quarter (Nuffield Health Hospital and Talbot Innovation Quarter) Together with Nuffield Health, we’ve submitted a planning application to BCP for a hospital and Innovation Quarter. We're closely connected to our former lands, which encompass educational settings, parkland and housing. Since the 1980s, two university campuses have thrived at Fern Barrow, renowned for art and design, media, and technology. Bournemouth University’s award-winning Talbot Campus houses many of its facilities, including the Faculty of Media & Communication, the Faculty of Science & Technology, the Doctoral College and much more. The university also now includes a secondary campus in the Lansdowne area of Bournemouth town centre. Neighbouring Arts University Bournemouth is home to Bournemouth Film School and the Innovation Studio. It’s a leading sector-specialist arts university for the creative industries with a strong maker culture. Our former estate now includes community assets like Slades Farm Park, home to Active Dorset, a charitable organisation aimed at enhancing physical activity and sport. Slades Farm Park includes a velodrome, skate park, playground, and Pavilion café.
