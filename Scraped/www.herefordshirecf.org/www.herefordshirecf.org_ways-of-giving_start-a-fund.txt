Permanent Fund Most of our donors choose to set up permanent endowment funds which provide everlasting support to the county. We invest your capital and use the dividend income to make grants year after year, with the potential to build up the fund over future generations of your family. We recommend a minimum pledge of £25,000. Flow-through Fund Alternatively, a flow-through fund provides the option for the full amount of your charitable giving to be awarded as grants over a specific time period. This means that your support can be put to immediate use. You can add to your fund as and when you wish, or not at all. Choose your level of involvement Our flexible approach means you can be as hands-on (or not) as you like. Typical ways to get involved include assessing applications and choosing who to support, through to visiting beneficiaries. However, many of our donors prefer to set their fund’s priorities and leave the rest to us. We’ll create a bespoke fund that suits your individual needs and the way you like to work. We can offer confidentiality for donors who wish to remain anonymous. How to Start a Fund with HCF ? Setting up a Named Fund with HCF is easy.

I am truly overjoyed by your decision to honour my appeal and I cannot wait to begin my course. This opportunity is both an honour and a privilege, and words can hardly capture the depth of my gratitude. My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone at the Hereford Community Foundation. It means so much to feel acknowledged—to have past experiences, which can sometimes carry a sense of shame, instead be met with understanding, and for my commitment to be recognised. For me, this gift is more than just a computer; it represents the chance to carve out a new path for myself. Thank you so much. I can see it’s already on my Octopus account, and it finally covers my debts there JACKSON PROPERTY has been supporting Herefordshire Community Foundation for many years because of the professionalism they bring in regarding grants that make a difference to lives of vulnerable, isolated and disadvantaged people of Herefordshire. I care about helping real people, not just ticking boxes. At first, £10 didn’t feel like much, it’s just me, after all, but I quickly realised that’s exactly the point. When we all chip in, it adds up. Business for Good felt like the right way to give: local, simple, meaningful.
