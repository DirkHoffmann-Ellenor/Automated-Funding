Most direct funding and support from Cornwall VSF and its partners is restricted to organisations operating in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly. Some UK-wide funds listed (e.g., Oliver Ford Foundation, The Hospital Saturday Fund) may be open to ellenor Hospice, but these are not administered by Cornwall VSF and would require direct application to those funders.",Low Match,"The majority of funding opportunities and support offered by Cornwall VSF are explicitly for organisations operating in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. For example, 'We partner with CCF to distribute funds via our Health Improvement Fund and Community Wellbeing Fund, through the People in Mind (PiM) partnership.' and 'Our aim is to support local charities, voluntary groups, and social enterprises to build a stronger and more sustainable community sector [in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly].' While some UK-wide funds are listed (e.g., The Hospital Saturday Fund, Oliver Ford Foundation), these are not specific to Cornwall VSF and are simply signposted for the benefit of local organisations. ellenor Hospice, being based in Kent, does not meet the core geographic eligibility for Cornwall VSF-administered funds. There is a low match for UK-wide funds that are merely listed on the site, but no direct eligibility for Cornwall VSF's own or Cornwall/Isles of Scilly-specific funding. Recommendation: ellenor Hospice should apply directly to the UK-wide funders listed, not through Cornwall VSF.",15,15,2025-10-15 10:34:01,
