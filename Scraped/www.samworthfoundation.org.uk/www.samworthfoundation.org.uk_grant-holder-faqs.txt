Here are the answers to some of the most common queries. If you cannot find what you need here, or would like to clarify something, please speak with your Grant Manager or call us on 01664 414500 When will I receive my grant? If your grant is successful you will receive a communication from your Grant Manager within 5 working days after our Trustee meeting. All grants are paid via bank transfer to the successful organisation. We will ask to see a bank statement dated within the last 3 months. After which your first grant payment will be received â€“ this is usually paid within 30 days of grant confirmation. When do you make grant payments? For multi-year grants, subsequent payments are subject to a satisfactory review of your annual grant report. When do I have to send you a progress report? Evaluation is undertaken in two ways. The first is through regular grant monitoring through informal reviews and the development of our relationship with each grant holder. The second takes a more formal approach through a written annual grant review and end of grant report. For more information, please see our Evaluation and Reporting guidelines . We are happy to be associated with the project. Further details can be found in the Press and Publicity section.
