This figure rises to one in two with regard to poorer children*. The issues causing the most concern for teachers are communication and language, physical, personal, social and emotional development, literacy and numeracy. Home-Start UK has a local community network of trained volunteers and expert support workers across England and Wales. It helps disadvantaged families with young children through their early years up to the age of five years old. This £1 million five-year partnership works with local Home-Start branches to get children from disadvantaged backgrounds school-ready. * Department for Education, Early years foundation stage profile results You can see the type of work this partnership is funding here: The Cranfield Trust The two-year £228,000 partnership with the Cranfield Trust links highly skilled volunteers with 60 frontline welfare charities and organisations to provide essential consultancy and mentoring services. The partnership provides tailored professional support to meet the needs of smaller charities and as a result, local communities will benefit from even better charity services.

This £300,000 partnership enables the Duke of Edinburgh (DofE) Award to reach at least 30,000 young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) by 2024. The ambition is to increase the number of centres, such as schools and youth groups, offering DofE to young people with SEND and train hundreds of Leaders – trained individuals supporting groups of young people through their DofE journeys. The programme has been designed to make DofE participation possible for students with diverse difficulties and disabilities. It helps the students to build crucial personal life skills, develop employability skills and become more independent, and aims to offer students the same experiences available to their peers in mainstream education.

Recognising that early-career research is often under-funded, the MCF focusses its medical research programme on funding PhD studentships, which we hope will help create the next generation of research experts and scientists. We have supported research into a range of diseases including Prostate cancer, Motor Neurone Disease, Alzheimer’s, heart disease and many more. Our medical research programme is invitation only; our current focus is childhood diseases and conditions.
