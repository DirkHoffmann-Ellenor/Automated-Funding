SMALL CHANGE for BIG CHANGE 'Small Change for Big Change’ is our innovative fundraising partnership with London restaurants Roka, Zuma, Coya and LPM. A voluntary donation of £1 is added to every bill and 100% goes directly towards our project partners. For twenty years, these funds were directed to eliminating cataract blindness in rural India and Nigeria. Together we've raised over £2 million and funded over 50,000 life transforming cataract surgeries through this initiative.
