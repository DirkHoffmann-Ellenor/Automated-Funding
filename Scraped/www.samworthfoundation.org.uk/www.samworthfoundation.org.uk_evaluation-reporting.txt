We ask all grantholders to report on their work, so that we can find out how the work we are funding is going. It also helps us to understand what more we could do to increase the impact of your work, how we can improve our support in the future and so we can celebrate what you achieve. Evaluation is undertaken in two ways. The first is through informal reviews and the development of a relationship with each grantholder. The second takes a more formal approach through a written annual grant review and end of grant report. Informal Reports We will aim to get in touch to catch up, either virtually or in-person throughout each year and at the end of each funding year. These informal updates allow us to discuss any challenges and achievements you’ve experienced, and enable us to provide any additional support. Annual Reports Annual reports are expected at the end of each year of the grant. We ask grantholders to submit a summary of progress to date, demonstrate outcomes and lessons learnt accompanied by a financial report. We provide a template for you to use but are happy to receive reports written for other donors or in your preferred format. End of Grant Evaluation Reports Your final report should reach us no later than three months after the grant has finished. We’d like to hear the difference the grant has made, lessons learnt, impact, how you plan to continue the work, or if it was a time limited project, how you have wound it down. You can also let us know about how you plan to share your experiences more widely or include other things you would like us to know. This also opens up the potential to explore any future funding opportunities. As before, we provide a template for you to use but are happy to receive reports written for other donors or in your preferred format.
