Support our work Why support our work? The MCF is your charity We build better lives by encouraging opportunity, promoting independence and improving wellbeing for Freemasons, their families and the wider community. Every year we support thousands of Freemasons and their families, in addition to funding the work of hundreds of local charities in communities across England and Wales. Watch our video to find out how your donation could change someone’s life! Every donation, big or small, makes a huge difference to the people we support. We asked Dave – a fundraiser from Northamptonshire & Huntingdonshire who has recently abseiled down the Spinnaker tower in Portsmouth – to tell us why he supports the MCF, and we surprised him with a personal message of thanks. Share your story If you have been helped by the MCF, we would love to hear from you! By sharing your story with us, you can help to spread the word about our work and encourage anyone else who might be struggling to ask for the help they need.
