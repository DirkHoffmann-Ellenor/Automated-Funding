Eligibility Blue Light Wellbeing Grants If you have an idea or a proposal, please submit an application, and if we have any further questions or clarifications we will get back to you. We are particularly keen to receive applications for projects that support individuals across multiple Blue Light services, fostering collaboration and shared learning. Initiatives that include clear, well-developed plans for continuing the work beyond the life of the grant will also be prioritised. Key Areas of Focus: Building Mental Health Resilience This area focuses on proactive, preventative measures to help members of the Blue Light community maintain their mental health and wellbeing. Projects funded under this focus should aim to equip individuals with the tools and strategies needed to stay well, handle stress effectively, and prevent mental health challenges before they arise. Examples of eligible initiatives include: Workshops and Training Programmes: Teaching evidence-based techniques such as stress management, mindfulness, and self-care practices tailored to high-pressure roles. Peer Support Programmes: Initiatives fostering connections among colleagues to provide emotional and practical support. Preventative Resources: Development of resources like mental health toolkits, apps, or guides designed to build resilience and promote mental wellness. Community Engagement Activities: Programmes encouraging physical activity, social interaction, or other wellbeing-promoting activities to help individuals sustain good mental health. Supporting People Living with Mental Health Issues This focus is aimed at providing direct support to individuals in the Blue Light community who are experiencing mental health challenges. Projects in this area should seek to help people recover, manage, or live well with mental health issues. Examples of eligible initiatives include: Therapeutic Support: Providing access to counselling, psychotherapy, or other formal therapies. Crisis Support Services: Establishing or expanding helplines, crisis lines, or rapid response support services. Recovery-Focused Programmes: Facilitating retreats, workshops, or peer support groups specifically for those managing mental health conditions. Practical Assistance: Helping individuals access support or resources to manage mental health challenges, such as referrals or navigation services. Foundation grants are offered up to a maximum of £25,000 . They can be towards running costs, projects, or equipment. The work can be new, continuing or a one-off initiative, but it must benefit current or former staff or volunteers within the Blue Light community with a sustainability plan post funding.
