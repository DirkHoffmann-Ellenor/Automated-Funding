The Foundation's main focus is on scholarships for individuals, not core funding for organisations. Some grants to organisations are mentioned, but these are for community initiatives supporting young people's education and wellbeing, not direct healthcare or hospice services.",Low Match,"The Black Heart Foundation's funding is primarily directed at individuals (students) from under-resourced backgrounds to support their educational aspirations, as detailed in the Scholarship Programme and FAQ sections. While the Foundation has supported some organisations, these are focused on educational and youth development initiatives (e.g., schools, youth academies, arts centres), not healthcare or hospice service providers. The Foundation does express an interest in children's health and wellbeing, but only as it relates to educational access and achievement. There is no evidence of grants for palliative care, end-of-life care, or direct support for hospices. The application process and eligibility criteria are tailored to individuals, not charities providing healthcare services. Therefore, ellenor Hospice, as a hospice and palliative care provider, is a low match for this funding opportunity.",15,15,2025-10-15 10:33:17,
