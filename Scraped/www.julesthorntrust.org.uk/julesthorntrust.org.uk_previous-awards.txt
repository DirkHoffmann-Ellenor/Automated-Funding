This funding is a huge boost to the WellChild Better at Home training programme. Caring for a child with serious and complex medical needs requires specialist knowledge and skills that are difficult to train at the bedside. Parent training is therefore one of the biggest barriers to getting a child out of hospital. By expanding this vital programme to new parts of the UK, we can give more parents and carers the skills and confidence to care for their children safely at home, where they will have the very best chance to thrive.” - Colin Dyer, CEO, WellChild “Your donation has supported our programme of workshops with people who have experience of, or at risk of, homelessness. Your support helped us provide expertise, advice and training in performing arts, giving our Members practical skills, a sense of community, and opportunities for self-expression.” - Michaela Clayton, Cardboard Citizens “Your amazing donation has helped seriously unwell and disabled people improve their lives through the opportunity to take accessible holidays or day trips on our Jumbulance. Thank you so much!” - Gill Berry, Jumbulance Trust This generous donation will help fund the specialist care and facilities provided for an adult on our in-patient unit for a week – helping to manage their pain and symptoms and making the difference for them and their families when it matters the most.” - Meg Davies, Keech Hospice Care “With the grant we received from the Trust we have been able to give 500 people who are sleeping rough in Cambridge a cooked breakfast. Once they have been fed with support from our project workers they are encouraged to access accommodation and healthcare to start to get their lives back on track” - Sarah Halls, Wintercomfort for the Homeless
