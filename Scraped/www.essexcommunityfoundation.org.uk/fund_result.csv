Some funds may support charities outside Essex or with specific links, but this is rare and usually at donor request. No explicit exclusion of hospices or palliative care, but Kent-based applicants are not routinely eligible.",Low Match,"1. ECF's core focus is on supporting voluntary organisations and charities benefiting people in Essex, as stated: 'we can support a wide range of voluntary organisations, activities and projects across Essex, but we can also give support outside of the county or to specific charities if required.' 2. The vast majority of funds and all example grants are for Essex-based beneficiaries or projects. 3. ellenor Hospice is based in Kent and serves Kent/London boroughs, not Essex. 4. There is no explicit exclusion of hospices or palliative care, and registered charities are eligible, but the geographic scope is a significant barrier. 5. Only in rare cases, at donor request, is support given outside Essex. 6. No open/rolling application status or deadlines are provided. 7.
