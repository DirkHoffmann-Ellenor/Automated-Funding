Individuals As individuals or families, we may often wonder how we can help make a difference in our local communities. It can be difficult to know of, or choose, charitable organisations to support and be confident that donations will be used effectively. By donating through us, we make it easy for you to support your local community or specific causes that you care about. It is easy to get involved with us â€“ you can start by making a donation to our Acorn Fund or you can set up your own charitable fund . By giving through us, either during your lifetime or by leaving a legacy , you can be confident that your donations will support local voluntary and community organisations that are making a difference across Essex. We would be pleased to talk to you about your ideas or wishes. Whatever your level of giving or area of interest, please contact Perry Norton.
