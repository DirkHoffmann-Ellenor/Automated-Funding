Our Open Grants Programme funds capital costs that support the infrastructure needs of small- and medium-sized charitable organisations working with disadvantaged and marginalised people and communities. Eligible organisations can apply for a grant to cover the costs of a building purchases, construction or refurbishment projects, vehicle or equipment purchases, and some digital infrastructure projects (such as apps, databases and websites). Within this programme, we prioritise organisations that embed lived experience across their work, and projects which will make a significant change to their work. âCapitalâ funding is a rare resource for what are often essential costs. Our grants have funded laptops that helped a small organisation become more efficient, a vehicle that allowed for greater reach, or a new building that transformed an organisationâs activities and sustainability. In the case of buildings, we know that owning this asset can increase the chances of an organisation surviving and thriving, particularly in economically disadvantaged areas.
