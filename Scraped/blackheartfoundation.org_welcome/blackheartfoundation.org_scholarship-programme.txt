As a student from a low-income background studying away from home, this scholarship will be invaluable. Beyond the practical support, this scholarship will also enable me to commit more fully to my involvement in helping other Widening Participation students like myself, a mission that resonates deeply with my passion to help students from less funded areas get into medical school. Thank you to the Black Hearts Foundation, for empowering me to reach my full potential. Your support is not only an investment in my education but also in my ability to give back and help others from similar backgrounds.” Adam Land Economy | University of Cambridge “Receiving the Black Heart Scholarship has been a transformative support for my academic, career, and personal development. Managing rising living costs and limited student finance has been a significant challenge, and this scholarship directly addresses these financial needs, allowing me to cover essential expenses like accommodation, educational materials, and involvement in extracurricular activities. With this added support, I am now able to fully participate in academic societies relevant to my career goals and access valuable resources, including coaching and courses for interviews, previously restricted by paywalls. This financial relief enables me to focus on my studies and career aspirations without the constant burden of financial strain, unlocking my full potential for growth and success. It has also provided me with the added assurance to consider my next career steps—whether to navigate the postgraduate space or go straight into work.” Jennifer Cambridge University | History of Art “Thanks to their support, I can now focus wholeheartedly on completing my degree in History of Art without the financial burden. Additionally the money will also allow me to fully immerse myself in my studies and explore the extracurricular activities I am so passionate about. With this grant, I now have the freedom to participate in art, theatre, and music, which have always been central to my personal and creative growth. These experiences will help enrich my education and shape my future aspirations, and I could not have done it without the support of the Black Heart Foundation. Thank you once again for making such a meaningful impact on my education and my future.” Olivia “My hope is to build a strong portfolio that will open doors in an industry often dominated by people who don’t look or behave like me. Receiving this scholarship has been transformative. It will allow me to remain focussed on both my academic pursuits and the rapidly changing industry.” Reuben Graphic Design | Loughborough University ““It was strange when I first received the email about being accepted into the Black Heart Foundation, a life-changing investment sitting in front of me that’d propel me so far in my future career. It allows me to remain mindful, without financial stress or worry, and gives me access to equipment that can propel my Graphic Design degree to new heights. Studying a creative subject I feel as though there aren’t many opportunities to make money and be focused on your coursework and this is a huge opportunity for people like me. I plan to give it my all to make sure I contribute to society via this investment. Thank you, Black Heart Foundation.” Bohdana Philosophy, Politics, and Economics | University of York “I couldn’t believe my eyes when I received an email from you with congratulations on the scholarship. I know how competitive the process was. I am delighted that you recognised my potential. With your generous help, I am now closer to realising my academic aspirations without worrying about financial circumstances. This means a great deal to me and my family, who have had to start our new lives in a new country. The course I am currently studying, a BSc in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics, is exactly what I desired. It sharpens my knowledge in three disciplines and encourages me to explore their interconnections. Thanks to your assistance, I can now engage in unpaid opportunities such as volunteering to build my skills and excel in my future career. I am inspired by your example to help others believe in their success, and I am committed to these values as well. I am currently volunteering in the charity sector as a community consultant and hope to gain valuable experience in this field alongside my academic goals. I am thrilled to be part of the community with devoted individuals who inspire each other.” Chienyemona Philosophy (Major), International Relations (Minor) and Sustainable Development (Minor) | University of St Andrews “Thanks to the Foundation, I am able to pursue my undergraduate studies in Philosophy at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, despite having my home in London. This support will allow me to flourish at the university of my dreams whilst not having to forgo time spent with my family or miss out on the chances presented by the hub that is London. Being able to pursue my passions in an environment of my choosing has engrained in me a gratitude that I will not forget in this lifetime – the Black Heart Foundation’s work is one that supports those like myself, fostering hope in young people.” Chigozia Business & Analytics | Northumbria University “This support has lifted a significant financial burden, allowing me to focus fully on my education and thrive in my course without the worry of meeting basic living expenses.

I am excited to focus on my studies without the burden of financial stress!.” Cynthia Cardiovascular Medicine and AI | Queen Mary University of London “Balancing my Ph.D. studies in Cardiovascular Medicine and Technology with part-time work and family responsibilities has been difficult. The Black Heart Foundation’s support has lifted a tremendous burden, enabling me to fully dedicate myself to my research and to community engagement. With this scholarship, I can immerse myself in advancing healthcare through technology, particularly artificial intelligence, to address cardiovascular disparities impacting underserved communities. I’m honoured to join the BHF scholar and alumni network, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to both academia and society.” Dhamindhar Aerospace Engineering with Pilot Studies | University of Liverpool “I am incredibly grateful to the donors, black heart foundation ambassadors and the black heart foundation as a whole to allow young students like myself to progress academically to achieve their career goals. I am an aspiring pilot and if you know anything about aviation, you’ll know how expensive of an investment it is. Scholarships like this not only help with acquiring the necessary qualifications but also helps towards putting you name out there for future opportunities. This donation not only alleviates pressure that could be impacting your studies, but also serves as a powerful reminder that there are people who believe your dreams as much as you do and who are willing to invest into your future. I am more motivated than ever to excel in my academic journey and to one day take to the skies as a professional pilot. I am truly grateful for this incredible opportunity, and I vow to make the most of it, knowing that your kindness will play a key role in helping me achieve my goals. Thank you for believing in me.” Divas Medicine | University of Southampton “Being from a disadvantaged background can be disheartening at times but due to the generosity from the BHF means that I can now approach exam season without having to worry about finances.

From the bottom of my heart thank you and may you continue to change the lives of other students, as you have done with mine.” Donell Writing and English Literature | Anglia Ruskin University “Being able to study Writing & English Literature is a dream opportunity in and of itself, but with this additional support, I feel secure in dedicating all of my focus towards having a fulfilling university experience without the stress of having to worry about where the money is coming from.

The relief this scholarship has brought to my family and me is deeply appreciated. Coming from a background where opportunities like this are rare, it’s truly encouraging to know that there is a foundation that believes in my potential. Your investment inspires me to work even harder, to honor your faith in me, and to show the results of this support in my academic journey and beyond. With this opportunity, I am determined to grow and eventually use my skills to make a meaningful difference in the world. This scholarship is a springboard that brings me closer to those goals, and for that, I am incredibly grateful. Thank you once again for helping me take this important step forward.” Edwin History | University College London “This scholarship represents more than just mere financial aid, but it also represents the faith the foundation had in me to strive for excellence in my educational and professional journey. Financial struggles is something no child should be burdened with growing up but unfortunately growing up it was something I was quickly exposed too. The BHF understood this and was generous enough to offer ambitious students like me the chance to not have to be burdened with it anymore. This scholarship gives me even more motivation to keep going and pursuing my dreams of changing the world around me and giving back to students who had similar stories and upbringings to me. This scholarship should be a reminder to any student looking to apply to university that despite your background or upbringing you are truly the “same as any, better than many, inferior to none.” Emmanuel Economics | Durham University “This generosity will allow me to have full focus on my educational success and allow me to not worry about financial burdens which may hold me back.Not only will the Scholarship allow me to pursue different talents during university, it will also allow me to express my talents after university, in which I hope to make a change in the financial world and encourage others similar to me to always push themselves. Again I am incredibly thankful to the Black Heart Scholarship Foundation committee.” Eszter Anthropology and Law | London School of Economics and Political Science “However, while university is ‘accessible’, the reality is that many don’t get to enjoy the full experience due to financial pressures. The Foundation’s generosity will allow me to now partake holistically in a London university life, by spending Wednesdays in sports training and partaking in summer internships rather than working. By fully immersing myself in my degree and the opportunities on offer, I believe I will be in a better position to tackle my legal career ahead, where I one day hope to improve access to justice and give a voice to the voiceless. I’m very grateful to be a part of this program and will be sure to prove that the decision to sponsor my education was the right one.” Fatwa Biomedical Science | St Georges University London “As a Black Muslim woman, often with the odds stacked against me, I am committed to completing my degree while honouring my religious beliefs and duties ,which are of great importance to me. Throughout my journey, I have faced various challenges but remained resilient, balancing work to fund my education without compromising my faith. Due to my religious principles, taking a loan for tuition fees was not an option, making this scholarship especially significant. Receiving this support allows me to focus fully on my studies, staying true to my beliefs while achieving my goals. This scholarship is essential in helping me fulfil my aspiration of giving back to my community by applying the skills and knowledge I have gained in clinical biosciences. The support of the Black Heart Foundation aligns with my mission to uplift others and drive positive change, and I am deeply honoured to be a recipient. Thank you for believing in my potential.” Hannah LLB Hons Law with Criminology | Lancaster University “Due to some unfortunate circumstances, my path to further education was obstructed and in my search for a way through, I discovered the many hurdles I would need to jump to excel in my chosen field as I did not know the system well. The Black Heart foundation’s scholarship has provided me with not only financial support but also peace of mind, allowing me to focus more and fully on my studies and personal growth. I am truly grateful for the opportunities this scholarship opens up and for your belief in my potential. I believe this will aid me in many ways and also keeps my family at ease. Thank you for your invaluable support.” Hilina Child Health – Developmental Neurosciences | University College London “The only thing that ever made me hesitant to apply for further education was the thought that I would be overwhelmed trying to support myself and balance my studies. But I don’t have this feeling any longer with the BHF’s support. I have a newfound appreciation and enthusiasm to excel in my studies because of the belief the BHF have in me. Thank you so much to the trustees of the Black Heart Foundation for being a shining light, helping others achieve their educational milestones.” Jamila Architecture | London South Bank University “As a first-year Architecture Apprentice, it has been difficult entering an industry where people often don’t understand the struggles of not coming from a white, middle-class background, and how much that’s able to impact opportunities. I’ve had to convince people that young people also have to work to live, which sometimes feels ridiculous. This scholarship helps me to not have to scrape by financially, and instead live and put my energy into my work and my dreams. By pursuing my goals, I hope to contribute to a better, more equitable society—one where everyone gets an actual chance to thrive, just as The Black Heart Foundation envisions.” Jasmine Fine Art | Central Saint Martins “It has relieved financial pressure, allowing me to focus more on excelling academically and on opportunities for development as an artist. Thank you so much Black Heart Foundation!.” Kody Geography and Environmental Science | King’s College London “I knew when applying, that the foundation would receive many deserving applications, so it was a shock when I received an email to say I was to receive a scholarship. The additional funds will help support my day to day living and studying costs in London throughout my degree, and allow me to focus 100% on my studies, without having the added pressure of worrying about my finances throughout my degree. Thank you so much.” Mariella Performing Arts Medicine | University College London “As a postgraduate learner; studying a full time masters, applying for my next stage of medical training, and juggling other commitments has been challenging. Alongside this it has also been difficult to work enough hours part time to cover the cost of the degree and living expenses. This masters will allow me to study and then hopefully specialise in an area of medicine I have always want to work in. It will help me grow in my clinical skills and knowledge and in my research skills. Receiving the scholarship has been a massive confidence boost and will also allow me more time to concentrating on my studies and career applications, to hopefully secure a speciality training job close to my friends and family. I cannot thank the Black Heart Foundation enough and I am excited to continue my studies with their support!.” Meyiwa Law (LLB) | University of Manchester “My involvement with the Black Heart Foundation has been pivotal in this pursuit. I was fortunate to receive a scholarship from the Foundation during my time at university, an award that has had a significant impact on both my academic and extracurricular activities. Throughout my academic career, I have faced significant financial hurdles that have hindered my ability to fully engage with all the opportunities available at university. Working long hours in a permanent job while balancing the demands of my LLB course has often left me physically and mentally exhausted, leading to challenges in maintaining a strong academic performance. The Black Heart Foundation’s support has been instrumental in alleviating some of these pressures, enabling me to focus more on my studies and less on financial survival. It has provided me with the necessary resources to pursue extracurricular activities, such as my role as Vice-President of Black Girls’ Space, where I was able to contribute meaningfully to the university community while also preparing for a career in law. This award from the Black Heart Foundation has reinforced my belief in the importance of support networks in higher education. With their continued support, I look forward to achieving my academic and professional goals and ultimately becoming a barrister.” Nia Diploma in Child Counselling | The Institute for Arts in Therapy & Education “Their support has made an immeasurable difference in my educational journey. I am now able to start my diploma in child counseling and move forward in pursuing my career in psychotherapy. Before receiving the grant, I was unsure when, or even if, I could afford to begin this course. The contribution provided by the Foundation has removed a significant financial burden, I am filled with a sense of relief, hope and excitement. To the Black Heart Foundation, thank you. Your support has made this possible, what once seemed like a distant dream is now a tangible reality. I am beyond grateful for your belief in me and my potential. I feel ready and equipped to take on this next chapter, and truly blessed to have this opportunity.” Salma Pharmacy Degree (MPharm) | University College London “This award has alleviated some of the financial burden I was facing, enabling me to cover my tuition fees, as a student who chooses not to take out student loans due to my religious beliefs. By easing this financial pressure, this scholarship has allowed me to focus more on my studies and pursue my academic goals with less stress. I look forward to making the most of this opportunity and contributing positively to the community as best as I can. Thank you, once again, for this support; it means a lot to me.” Sepehr Medicine | University of Sheffield “Living as a first-generation immigrant in an area where opportunities of social mobility are extremely scarce, I was elated to receive this scholarship as it has taken off a huge financial burden from both me and my family. Indeed, this has allowed me to better focus and dedicate myself to my study of medicine and greatly reduced the stress of living costs on me while I live away from home. This scholarship will allow me to pursue my interests, join clubs and make the most of the opportunities presented to me so that I may excel in my five-year medical school career.” Stephanie International Business | Nottingham Trent University “I come from a low socio-economic and a single, surviving-parent household and was also the first to attend university. Finances aren’t something anyone, let alone a young person should ever have to worry about. However, due to the kindness of the Foundation, they have alleviated a massive financial burden which will allow me to fully immerse myself in the final year of my International Business undergraduate degree. With the Black Heart Foundation Scholarship’s support, I am determined to excel in my graduate scheme and summer internship applications in the Built Environment industry, whilst preparing myself to contribute meaningfully to a more diverse and successful real estate landscape in the UK and one day globally.” Tolga Law | London School of Economics and Political Science “Although I did not have much confidence in myself to apply, I still applied hoping for a positive outcome. Studying and living in London has proven to be much more expensive than I realised; the rental market was very lucrative, the transport costs continuously added up, and everyday essentials such as groceries were comparatively higher priced than back home. Although I managed to secure a part-time job when I commenced my studies, I am often left struggling to make ends meet. Therefore, finding out I was awarded the scholarship felt like a major relief to me, and a brilliant start to my second year of studies. I am now able to focus more on my studies, with the peace of mind that my essential needs are comfortably met. Receiving the support of the Black Heart Foundation has allowed me to continue my studies and no longer consider having to withdraw from doing a degree that I love, at a university I love, due to the financial constraints it comes with. After my degree, my key focus is to give back; I intend to engage in pro-bono work for families who are immigrating to the UK, and LGBTQ individuals who have been estranged from their families. I sincerely appreciate the Black Heart Foundation and their continuing efforts to ensure that education is accessible to all.” Yashna Aerospace Engineering | Swansea University “I am truly thankful for this opportunity and for being part of this community of scholars. I’ve just entered my final year at Swansea University, completing my BEng Aerospace Engineering degree. Throughout my academic journey, university has been about testing your limits and creating unforgettable memories, and finances should not be a stressful factor to hinder your capability. That’s what the Black Heart Foundation believes in. This chance has lifted a burden off me and my family, which has opened many possibilities towards my future in working on innovative engineering projects. I finally feel like I can focus on my studies and have confidence in achieving more. Thank you again to this programme, for having faith in students’ dreams.” Adam Mathematics | University of Oxford “Keeping true to my religious beliefs and avoiding student loans, I was constantly worrying about how I could fund my living costs at university. This scholarship gets rid of my former worries, meaning that I won’t have to keep such a close eye on how deep I’ve gone into overdraft. I can now wholeheartedly focus on my studies and brush financial stress aside. Thank you to the Black Heart Foundation and everyone involved for recognising that finances should not limit students from reaching their potential. It means so much to be among those who get to benefit from this incredible scholarship, and I look forward to the day I will be able to pass it forward!” Ailin Mathematics and Statistics | King’s College London “Due to the great assistance I have been provided by this incredible fund, I can pursue my dreams studying Computer Science at the University of Oxford breaking through obstacles as a minority woman. Being at university, has created a stimulating environment in which I can pursue many of my different interests both within the field of my degree and extracurrculars such as sporting and musical events which are two of my biggest passions . This fund will allow me to continue to immerse myself within the university culture without worrying about the financial implications it may have. Thus, giving me the best opportunity to do well in my studies and become a well-rounded individual. Moving into the new year, I am thrilled by the new doors which have now been opened for me.” Eden Civil Litgation, Criminal Litigation and Advocacy | Inns of Court College of Advocacy “Black female barristers make up less than 3% of practitioners at the Bar, and I am thankful that this scholarship will give me a chance to contribute to increasing that statistic. Qualifying as a barrister is an incredibly expensive process, which disqualifies many BAME students from ever attaining it. I am grateful to the Black Heart Foundation for making such a far-removed aspiration a possibility.” Hannah Inequalities and Social Sciences | London School of Economics and Political Sciences “Their support enables me to contribute towards my school fees as I learn about inequalities and how to address them. The funding provided by the Black Heart Foundation allows me to dedicate more time to my studies. I work over 30 hours a week to cover my university expenses and living costs, leaving me with little time for myself, my relationships, or my university work. However, with this grant, I can reclaim some of that time and strive towards my goals.” James Environmental and social change | Royal Holloway University of London “It was as though I had finally been given a break and had been recognised for my hard work and determination to achieve higher in my education than I had ever imagined growing up. I cannot be thankful enough to the Foundation for the opportunity they have provided me, allowing me to focus more on my studies at the pivotal point of my final year at university. I am now able to carry out research for my dissertation in the field of sustainability, which I hope will provide evidence for me to take my research further and make a real difference in the world. I hope to be an active alumnus, providing support and hope to those who follow, and helping to push young people facing disadvantages further in their education—just as the Foundation has helped me in my own journey.” Mariline Post Graduate certificate in education Primary education with QTS | Middlesex University “Shock, happiness, and excitement all flooded through me at once. It felt surreal, almost too good to be true. Words cannot express how grateful I am for the Black Heart Foundation. This financial support will benefit me throughout this academic year, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my studies and pursue my extracurricular activities without the burden of financial constraints. I only became aware of the Black Heart Foundation scholarship during my second year of studying. At that time, I hesitated to apply as I was uncertain about the outcome. However, now that I have taken the leap and applied during my final year of studies, I wholeheartedly encourage every eligible individual to do the same. The application process is remarkably simple making it accessible to a wide range of students. I want to express my deepest gratitude to the Black Heart Foundation for their belief in me and their commitment to supporting students like myself. This scholarship has not only alleviated my financial worries but has also instilled in me a renewed sense of confidence and motivation to excel academically.” Moona Adult Nursing | University of Birmingham “The foundation has taken a step further and laid the last brick on what is my colosseum of prospects by recognising my vitality and expansiveness. It is utterly impossible for me to express how much this means to me and my family, for I fear my mouth would not do my sentiments complete justice. It is extremely difficult to find external organisations that offer financial aid for prospective students nationwide, so it is very refreshing (to say the least) seeing the level of support made possible by the scholarships’ unwavering generosity. The extracurricular ventures I had to once abandon have suddenly appeared ever feasible now, and I cannot wait to salute my efforts to the people who made them all achievable. This milestone will commit me to my chosen profession as a student nurse; I can only hope that I do all those dependent on me, in whatever way, proud, for it is all I truly wish for as the daughter of history, thirsty for a legacy of her own making. My labyrinth of burdensome tribulations has dwindled down. Now marks the footpath of my many triumphs and successes. To the programme, no matter the world, physical or spiritual, I will from henceforth be in a sea of indebtedness to your gesture of implicit understanding and kindness.” Peace Medicine BMBS Clinical Elective USMLE Step 1 | Brighton & Sussex Medical School “Getting to this point has not been without significant difficulties and hardship, but this generous boost will enable me to finish five years on a high note and pursue an international elective in emergency medicine in Africa. It will also help me balance living costs while completing my final placement, without the need to work myself to the ground in my part-time job simultaneously. Opportunities like these don’t normally happen for people like me, and financial barriers show up in so many different ways, specifically ones that thwart your confidence and belief in whether you can complete the course you set your heart on. I’m so appreciative of the opportunity to be on a level playing field with my peers, and I only wish I had known about the foundation sooner. Thank you!” Rowan Music: Vocal Performance (tenor) | Royal Conservatoire of Scotland “He recently graduated from the Royal Northern College of Music under Paul Nilon where he was the recipient of the Rollo-Davidson Scholarship and was awarded a first-class honours degree.

Rowan is thrilled to be supported by the Black Heart Foundation Scholarship Fund which is being used to support his studies at the RCS. ” Victor Medicine | University of Cambridge “As a final-year medical student, managing the financial demands of university alongside an intensive course has been tough. The rising cost of living has made it even harder to balance studying with the stress of covering essentials like rent, food, and travel for placements.This scholarship lifts a huge weight off my shoulders. It means I can focus fully on my studies without constantly worrying about making ends meet. It also allows me to take part in more academic and social opportunities that would have otherwise been out of reach. I’m incredibly grateful for this support—it’s making a real difference, and I can’t thank The Black Heart Foundation enough!” ZOE MEDICINE MBChB | UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER “I am so grateful for their support! It is so inspiring that there are people out there who truly see the potential in black students like myself and are willing to generously support our dreams. Finances have honestly been one of the biggest sources of stress over the duration of my studies and I truly feel like a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders thanks to the incredible help I have received. I can now focus fully on my final year exams instead of spending these crucial moments on working to fund my daily living costs. I hope that one day I will be able to return this massive favour and be the one helping the future generation of black academics. I will never forget the kindness and generosity that I have been so fortunate to receive from you!” Adetiwa Law LLB | University of Reading “This was the best possible time to receive the news of my grant with no exaggeration. Before then, I would find myself constantly stressing how I would make ends meet without sacrificing my grades. It even had me questioning whether University was the right path for me financially. This is because I haven’t had the financial support of my parents since I was 16 because of our low-income background. Now that I have the scholarship, I can focus more on my studies and not worry about financial burdens . ” Blessie Biomedical Sciences (C130) | University of Liverpool “This award will greatly assist me as I pursue my Biomedical Science degree at the University of Liverpool.

This scholarship has decisively alleviated the financial burden that once felt daunting, empowering me to concentrate fully on my studies and seize every opportunity that university life presents. From attending lectures and immersing myself in coursework to engaging in internships and networking within the finance sector, I am actively pursuing my dreams without the limitations of financial constraints. Studying finance is not just about academics for me; it is about changing the narrative and striving for a future where financial freedom is attainable for everyone. The Black Heart Foundation’s mission to support ambitious and hardworking individuals aligns seamlessly with my vision, and I am proud to be a part of this remarkable community. This scholarship provides essential support and serves as a powerful motivation. It indicates that others believe in my potential and the impact I intend to make. I stand ready to represent the Foundation’s contribution to its vision of uplifting individuals from underrepresented backgrounds. Thank you, Black Heart Foundation, for believing in my potential and enabling me to dedicate myself wholeheartedly to my studies and ambitions. Your generosity has significantly changed my life, and I am committed to using this opportunity to create a meaningful impact in the world. ” Princess-Aaliyah Fashion imaging and Illustration | UAL “As a Fashion Imaging and Illustration student, I have always had a deep passion for creative storytelling through illustration, design, textiles, and animation. However, financial limitations have often made it difficult for me to fully invest in my craft and take my work to the next level. This scholarship allows me to turn my creative skills into a business, providing me with the necessary tools to produce prints, apparel, and custom designs. It also enables me to build a functional workspace at home, which is essential due to my limited living space and the need for an organized creative environment. Having access to the right equipment and materials will allow me to work more efficiently and expand my artistic capabilities. Beyond the financial support, this scholarship represents a belief in my potential. It gives me the confidence to grow my brand, document my journey through vlogging, and showcase my creative process online. By sharing my work and inspiring others, I hope to build a sustainable career that allows me to uplift and empower creatives like myself. This opportunity gives me the ability to focus on developing my skills without the constant worry of financial setbacks. I am deeply grateful for The Black Heart Foundation’s generosity.
