Setting up a charitable fund Setting up a charitable fund is an excellent option if you have a strong interest in supporting a particular cause or would like to be more actively engaged in your charitable giving. Whether you are an individual, family or business, we will work with you to create a fund that best suits your charitable goals. How involved you are with your fund is your choice. You can recommend charities, participate in beneficiary visits, raise funds for a specific cause, meet other donors, or you can simply determine your fund’s charitable intention and leave everything to us. Setting up a charitable fund with us is easy: Talk to us about what is the best option for you Choose a name for your fund Sign our donor agreement Transfer funds – we can accept cash and gifts of shares. Once your fund is established, you will join our community of fundholders and receive annual reports on your fund’s activities. We can also keep you up-to-date on our work and share stories about what’s going on in local communities.
