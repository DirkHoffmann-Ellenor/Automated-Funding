NO UNNECESSARY OBSTACLES We don't ever want to waste your time. We aim to make applying for our grants as straight-forward as possible. We ask for the information we need, and no more. We provide the clearest information about who and what we can fund. And when it comes to post-award reporting, we keep it as straightforward and light-touch as we can. WE FOCUS ON WHAT IMPACT OUR GRANTS WILL HAVE Broadly, this is a concern with improvement and success in education, training and employment for Lambeth citizens from low income households. WE ARE FAIR AND CONSISTENT We apply consistent eligibility criteria; we do not discriminate on any basis other than income and residence in Lambeth. (And age - the vast bulk of our grants are required by our charity Scheme to be given to under 30s) ​ Our approach as a Grantmaker ​ WE AIM TO BE OPEN IN OUR DEALINGS WITH APPLICANTS We're interested in grown-up conversations and start with the wish to help applicants if we can. WE ARE KEEN TO LEARN We are open to new ideas and to constructive feedback, always interested in new ways of achieving our aims.
