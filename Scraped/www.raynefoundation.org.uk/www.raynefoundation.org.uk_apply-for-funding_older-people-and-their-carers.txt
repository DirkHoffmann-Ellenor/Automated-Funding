Why we prioritise this area Research conducted by Age UK has shown that, in the UK: Around 1.6 million people aged 65+ have unmet needs for care and support Approximately 45% of people over 85 have difficulties with activities of daily living 36,000 fewer older people were receiving long-term care from local authorities in 2021 than in 2018 What we fund Applicant FAQs Featured projects Check eligibility & apply What we fund We focus on projects and organisations reimagining community provision for people drawing on care in later life. This means we fund work that’s closely aligned with our criteria of doing things differently and enabling innovation with the potential for wider application. We fund work that meets two or more of the following: Driven by collaboration in a particular place Connects the dots of care provision for people drawing on care in later life and their carers. Increases agency, voice, and visibility of people in later life and their carers. Embeds and sustains creativity and the arts in the delivery of care. The rolling grants programme is open to receive new applications. Better Careers for Better Care programme Better Careers for Better Care is our proactive funding programme focused on workforce development within social care. Between November 2023 and January 2024, we ran an open call and have awarded eight grants as part of the programme. The programme is not currently open to new applications. Learn more about the programme here . Funding criteria The Rayne Foundation funds work that: Is based on different thinking and enables innovation Has potential for wider application beyond the funded proposal Is informed by direct delivery and has a clear, positive impact on people’s lives Can demonstrate match-funding contributions to the project Enables and encourages collaboration between sectors and silos Develops best practice and captures learnings to share with others Adds to sector expertise and leadership When assessing an application, we look for good ideas from which others can learn and that have lessons beyond the local. We believe that to contribute to lasting social change, we must support creative and collaborative approaches that build and test solutions to some of the most difficult challenges society faces, so we like to fund innovative projects that approach issues differently. It’s important to us that the organisations we fund are outward-facing, networked, and actively seeking to collaborate. We believe this maximises the potential for learning to be shared and for our funding to have impact beyond the immediate grant.

Application guidance Applicant FAQ's The Rayne Foundation funds project and salary costs of usually £10,000 to £30,000 per year for up to three years. This is a guide, and we encourage you to talk to us if this grant size and duration doesn’t work for you. We consider applications for core costs, but prefer to do so when we have an established relationship with the applicant, usually through previous project funding. Statutory organisations need to consider how a grant from us will enable transformation over and above the funding required to deliver statutory obligations. For-profit organisations need to make the case that charitable funding is necessary to enable transformative change. We expect statutory and for-profit organisations to work collaboratively with the wider voluntary sector.

When assessing this, we’re seeking to feel confident in your organisation’s ability to deliver the proposed work, and understand how you will evaluate it and capture any learning. After assessing the full application, we may arrange a visit to your organisation. Following this, we will decide whether to take the application to our Board of Trustees for a decision.
