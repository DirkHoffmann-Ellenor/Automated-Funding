Home About the Foundation Who we are Causes we support Introduction Education Civil Society Non-Strategic Past Giving Introduction Education Civil Society Non-Strategic Past Giving Grant recipients Apply for funding Education At the root of a strong society is an educated populace with access to good quality information. Without education, people struggle to participate in decision-making and change: therefore, we support projects which promote education for all people. We are interested in funding projects that work on improving policy, improving practices and pedagogy and testing new techniques and / or interventions. We favour grants directed at education in support of economic and social well-being, primarily in the UK and historically in South Africa. Due to our limited resources we are unable to fund grants in any other countries. In the UK we are primarily looking to fund work focused on technical / vocational education, out of school / after school mentoring, the preparedness of young people with regard to life skills and employability, and the development of young leaders. We are interested in pilot projects or those that provide a proof of concept, projects that influence policy and those that explore the role(s) of new technology in education. We do not provide funds for building or rebuilding schools, individual schools or school projects, school equipment, scaling up projects, bursaries for individual school children / undergraduate education, or civic education / citizenship education programmes.
