Frequently asked questions Established in 2022, the Blue Light Card Foundation exists to give back to those who dedicate their careers to keeping the UK safe, healthy, and supported. We champion the physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing of the entire Blue Light Community, across health, emergency, social care, and armed forces, recognising the vital role they play in our society every day. Building mental health resilience : Grants will support initiatives that promote proactive measures to strengthen mental health resilience, support staying well, and prevent challenges before they arise. An example could be funding a programme that provides evidence-based workshops for emergency responders, teaching stress management techniques, mindfulness practices, and peer support strategies. These initiatives aim to build resilience, enhance overall wellbeing, and equip individuals with the tools to stay mentally healthy in high-pressure environments. Supporting people living with mental health issues : The grants will support mental health services, including formal therapies such as counselling and psychotherapy and crisis lines. As well as informal approaches like peer support groups and mindfulness workshops, retreats, alongside practical assistance to ensure emergency responders receive the care they need during challenging times.

You must have a governing document (constitution, rules, memorandum, and articles of association etc.), a governing body of at least three unrelated individuals, and a bank account in your group’s name with at least two unrelated signatories. Community Interest Companies (CICs) and other non-charitable social enterprises with a business plan that shows realistic aspirations for non-grant income generation can apply for a restricted grant to support the charitable costs of any start-up or expansion. We do not normally support such organisations with the costs of continuing services, which should be financed by the sale of goods and services in line with the governance model they have chosen.
