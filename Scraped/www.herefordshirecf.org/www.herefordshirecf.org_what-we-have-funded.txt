Enabling individuals, families and charitable organisations to easily set up funds Organisations with charitable motives can make use of our know-how to easily set up their own funds. We navigate the legal and governance requirements on their behalf, so they can concentrate on distributing funds. Our expertise means they can proceed, safe in the knowledge that everything is being managed properly. At HCF, we are also here to help families and individuals set up memorial and legacy funds. They are a great way to honour a loved one and give in perpetuity to the causes you care about by making a single gift that keeps on giving, i.e. an endowment fund. We can help reduce the administrative burden of setting up a separate charitable memorial trust/foundation with the Charity Commission. Examples of projects we have supported in this way include: Memorial and Legacy Funds Andrew Basnett Fund was set up in 2025 and remembers the talents of international blacksmith and art metal worker Andrew Basnett, by inspiring and supporting the next generations of artisans. George’s Fund is a fund set up by Laura Hughes in 2020 to celebrate the short and special life of her son George. The fund has given out £71,796 in grants across two rounds of funding for projects that promote the interests of Herefordshire’s primary-age children. Joanies Fund was set up in 2003 in memory of Joan Simpson and Joan Hughes. Their legacy is supporting a wide range of community projects that work with young people aged 0 to 25, leading to employment, accreditation, further education, training, and integration. The fund is open to applications across England and Wales.
