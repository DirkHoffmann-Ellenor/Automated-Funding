Match-Funding Grant Application Process Our Match-Funding Grant is open to all CareTech staff and Service Users for their individual fundraising efforts for charitable causes in line with our Charitable Objectives. We want to celebrate your efforts and support charities you are passionate about. All CareTech staff and their service users are eligible to apply for the grant of up to £350 per year for their fundraising activity for a charity registered in the UK. Fill out the online application form (if you have any problems, please request a paper copy at info@caretechfoundation.org.uk ). Apply Now A staff member will read your application within two weeks and contact you by email if we need any further information – the application process moves more quickly when we have all the information we need! Your application is then put forward to the grant panel, who will consider your application against the fund guidelines. Once a decision has been reached on your application (we always aim to inform you of the outcome within 3 weeks of application), we will email you the outcome. If you have been successful, we will then arrange with you how we will pay the grant to the recipient charity – we may have to ask you to contact the charity for payment details and the correct payment reference to ensure the match-fund is added to your fundraising total. We will then pay the grant to the charity. We will also ask you if you would like to write a short piece and include photos that we may then put on our website and social media!
