Grant eligibility Our guidelines The trustees have decided to give annual support to a number of charities and proactively seek out certain projects. This restricts the funds available for general applications and as such the Trust is closed to unsolicited applications . Therefore we are keen that applicants do not waste their valuable time and our limited resources by submitting applications unless specifically asked to do so. Our grant-making aims The Trust’s objective is to make grants to support projects within the four categories listed below, and to continue funding, where appropriate, many of the organisations where long term relationships have been established. Who receives our grants? The Trust mainly gives to UK registered charities and other official charitable organisations. Charitable categories The allocation between these categories varies from year to year.
