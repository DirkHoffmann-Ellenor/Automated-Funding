We combine our expertise in health with real-time research and evidence from communities on the ground to deliver vital and timely solutions to some of society’s biggest health issues. Find out more about our programmes below Our Health Justice Fund provides a route through which communities experiencing the sharp end of health inequalities can work with us, using their experience and practice, to improve health for the long term. Nature for Health, a priority within the Health Justice Fund aims to support people’s mental health through improved access to nature. Active Communities funds community groups, not-for-profit organisations and local people wanting to create fairer places to grow, live, work and age. We fund projects led by and for people living in neighbourhoods experiencing the highest levels of social and financial disadvantage, and groups of people in society that are most affected by health inequalities. Becoming a funded partner will provide you and your colleagues with access to our wide-ranging offer of support.
