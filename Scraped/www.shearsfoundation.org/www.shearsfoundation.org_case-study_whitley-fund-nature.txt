WFN gives funding, training and recognition to local conservation leaders working in resource-poor, biodiversity-rich countries. We offer three types of grant to enable conservationists to scale up their vital work and make a real and measurable difference to wildlife and local communities. We are very grateful to the Shears Foundation for their long-standing and far-reaching support over the past twelve years, during which time your combined donation of £600,000 has had a very meaningful impact on WFN’s work supporting the world’s most effective grassroots conservation leaders. The Shears Foundation helps form the bed rock of the charity, and your support encourages many other donors to stay with us and match your long term commitment.
