Our story Longleigh Foundation was established in 2015 by Stonewater to help residents and communities whose needs were not being met. Rising financial pressures, reduced public services, and changes to welfare mean that support is more needed than ever. Stonewater recognised that a charitable foundation could do more than a landlord alone by helping people and communities at the right time. Longleighâ€™s work has continued to grow, with support from Stonewater and other partners across the UK. How we make a difference We focus on initiatives that make a lasting difference.
