Christmas Challenge 2023 Our Impact Our Christmas Challenge 2023 matched-funding campaign ran from Tuesday 28th November to Tuesday 5th December 2023 and it has been our biggest campaign to date. Together, we raised a remarkable £4,744,965 – a huge 18% increase on last year’s Christmas Challenge! These funds will support the delivery of 88 projects across London, ranging from projects that provide hot, nutritious meals to hungry children to projects that provide safe play spaces, improve resilience and build confidence, helping 200,000 children experiencing poverty this year. The campaign support is brilliant and enables us as a small organisation to run an effective campaign that we couldn't otherwise do! The Childhood Trust has always been incredibly supportive and generous. The team is very friendly, and we are extremely grateful for your support over the years! We have always had a great experience when working with The Childhood Trust and have found the team to be incredibly understanding and responsive. We look forward to working together in the future!
