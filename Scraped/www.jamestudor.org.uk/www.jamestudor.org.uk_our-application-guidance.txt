0117 959 6496 grants@jamestudor.org.uk Our application guidance We aim for our application process to be easy and accessible and we are always happy to help OUR APPLICATION GUIDANCE We appreciate the very difficult fundraising climate for many charities at this time. However, please be advised that our Trustees do not welcome speculative applications from ineligible charities. We lack the funds to support every eligible request we receive, and we are therefore unable to support ineligible charities. As a small team, we make every effort to respond to each enquiry we receive; however, responding to ineligible applications places a strain on our limited resources. Thank you in advance for complying with our eligibility criteria. If you are not eligible, please do not apply. Before applying Please review our What we don’t fund page to ensure your organisation and project are eligible for consideration by The Foundation. If your organisation and proposed service meet our eligibility criteria, but any of the following apply: you are a current grant holder; or you have received a grant from us in each of the last three consecutive years; or you have had an Expression of Interest or Full Application declined within the past 12 months; you can check our Applicants FAQs or our Grant holders FAQs to find out when you are next eligible to apply. If you're unsure whether your internal records are up to date, please email us or call us on 0117 9596496 and we’ll be happy to advise. How to apply to the Physical Health and Mental Health programmes We operate a two-stage application process for our Physical Health and Mental Health programmes: an Expression of Interest (open to all eligible organisations) followed by a Full Application (on invitation only). Expression of Interest: To access it, you need to complete the Eligibility Checker . Drafting your application: We recommend drafting your Expression of Interest and Full Application offline first and coping and pasting your answers on the online forms once you are ready to submit. We provide guidance drafting documents (see point below), and the online Full Application form also provides the opportunity to upload additional documents if you feel that these would add value. Application guidance and drafting documents: Links to these can be found in the Application guidance and drafting documents section of the relevant funding programme information page. These are Word documents which replicate the online Expression of Interest and Full Application forms, provide guidance on each question, and can be used to prepare your application offline. "Save & Resume": The Full Application online form has a "Save & Resume" function, but it relies on a password set by you, the applicant. If that password is lost, we don't have the possibility to reset it for you, and you have to start afresh. In addition, the online forms don't have a "review your answers before you submit" page (though you can go back to previous pages one by one). Preparing your answers online is therefore recommended. Deadlines: Application deadlines and grant round timelines are included in the relevant funding programme pages in the When to apply section. We do not accept Full Applications by email from organisations that have not been invited to apply. How to apply to the Hospice Care programme Applications to our Hospice Care programme are assessed through a single-stage process (applications to this programme will open in October 2025). To access the Expression of Interest you need to complete the Eligibility Checker . Application deadlines and grant round timelines are included on this page in the When to apply section.
