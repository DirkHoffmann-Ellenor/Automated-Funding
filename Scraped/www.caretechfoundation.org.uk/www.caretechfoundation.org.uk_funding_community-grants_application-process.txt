Application Process Community Grant We know how important it is to support local causes and loved ones. Our innovative Community Grant was created to support friends and families of CareTech staff facing significant financial hardship or for issues affecting local communities in which CareTech operates. You can apply for up to £2,500 per calendar year. As a CareTech staff member, you can sponsor an application to support people and causes you care most about. If you would like to apply for the Community Grant, please follow the four steps below to complete your application. You can complete the online application form by clicking the button below Apply Now If you are having difficulty accessing or completing the online application, please e-mail info@caretechfoundation.org.uk and request a paper or digital/Word version of the application form. We can also provide you with support to fill in the application. A staff member will aim to read your application within two weeks and contact you to arrange a time for us to call you. A member of staff will speak to you to make sure that we fully understand your situation. Your application is then put forward to the grant panel, who will consider your application against the fund guidelines. The Foundation’s team considers all applications for these grants and makes recommendations to the Board of trustees. Once a decision has been reached on your application (we always aim to inform you of the outcome within 3 weeks of application), we will email you the outcome. If you have been successful, we will let you know the next steps by outcome, such as how much trustees have awarded, for what purposes, and how this will be paid. Our team will then arrange the grant to be paid as outlined in the outcome email. Apply for a Community Grant To apply for a Community Grant, click below to start the application process.
