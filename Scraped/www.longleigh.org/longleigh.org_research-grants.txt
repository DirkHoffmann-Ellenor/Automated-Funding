Research Grants Partner with us to take a lot at the biggest issues facing social housing and the people who live in it. We fund research that delivers practical insight, shapes policy, and helps create lasting change. If your organisation has the expertise and vision to work with us, we’d like to hear from you. Longleigh Foundation is an independent charitable foundation working alongside social housing residents and communities across England. Why we fund research We truly believe that strong evidence leads to better decision making. Research helps us: Understand the real challenges social housing residents face. Test solutions that improve lives and strengthen communities. Share knowledge that influences housing providers, charities, and policymakers. Advocate for policy changes that address systemic issues in social housing. How we work with research partners When we identify an issue that needs more evidence, we launch a call for research partners. These open calls set out: The focus and aims of the research. The expertise and approaches we are looking for. The project budget and timescales. How and when to submit a proposal. This process allows us to find the right partner for each project, ensuring high-quality, relevant and practical research. What we look for in research partners We work with academic institutions, think tanks, consultancies and independent researchers. Successful partners usually have: Expertise in housing, social policy or related areas. A track record of delivering clear, high quality research. Creative methods for uncovering practical, actionable solutions. Examples of our research Our projects explore areas where evidence can drive meaningful change. For example: Current work on the challenges of affordable social housing in rural communities . A three-year research project with Altair into the impact of families moving into social housing without floor coverings, building the case for policy reform. The INVITE project aimed to investigate how assistive and everyday technologies can be used in retirement living properties to improve residents’ quality of life.
