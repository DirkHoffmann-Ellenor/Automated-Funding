The Wallace Collection – Access Programme Report: April 2023–March 2024 We believe that everyone can learn with the Wallace Collection. Our accessible events and resources engage people who need additional support to take part in our public programmes. In 2023–24, thanks to the continued generosity of the Lord Leonard and Lady Estelle Wolfson Foundation, we delivered 14 vibrant, bespoke events for D/deaf, blind and partially sighted, and neurodiverse audiences, reaching 172 participants. With the knowledge and experience gained over years of access programme delivery funded by the Foundation, we have also improved the accessibility of our core offerings. More public events are now supported with accessible interpretation. We have ensured many of our headline talks have live captions for people who are D/deaf, and our audio-described events and online content support audiences who are blind or partially-sighted.
