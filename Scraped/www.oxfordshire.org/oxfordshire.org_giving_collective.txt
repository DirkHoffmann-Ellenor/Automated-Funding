By supporting a collective fund, you can direct your giving towards a particular geography or issue. We believe that people and organisations can have a bigger impact by pooling their funds together. Collective giving allows multiple donors to contribute to shared funds that have a particular theme or focus. The combined power of donors’ funding, as well as their passion for the issue, means these funds have great momentum and can make a long-term positive difference to our communities. Below are the collective funds that OCF already hosts and accepts donations into. If you are interested in joining with like-minded people of organisations within an existing fund, or in setting up a new collective fund, please contact our Deputy CEO Kate Parrinder.
