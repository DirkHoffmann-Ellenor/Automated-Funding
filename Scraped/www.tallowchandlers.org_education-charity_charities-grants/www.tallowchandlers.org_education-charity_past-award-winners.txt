Past Award Winners All our award winners become the Tallow Chandlers’ Company’s alumni : Past Award Winners. The Company maintains its link with its Past Award Winners through an annual (free) Supper held in their honour. Past Award Winners can also join the Company as Associate Members, a special category designed to give an award winner a 'taste' of the Company. Associate Members can go on to join the Company as Freemen. Past Award Winners' Supper Each Autumn we invite our Past Award Winners to a special Supper at the Hall. It is an opportunity for the Company to keep in touch with its alumni, and for award winners to network. This year’s Supper will be held on 23rd October 2025. Please contact our Education and Charity Manager at estelle@tallowchandlers.org if you would like to attend. It was a great pleasure for the Master and members of the Company to welcome 72 award recipients, from the 1970s to 2024, to last year’s Supper.
