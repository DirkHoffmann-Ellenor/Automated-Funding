Young People The Trust funds organisations working with young people to help provide them with the skills to allow them to make a good start in life. It looks to provide children and young people with confidence, team working, and resilience. It has funded a range of organisations in this area—from those working on employment skills, through to those working with young people on sport and youth groups. Parenting The Trust believes that support for parents is vital to help children have the best possible start. It provides help to parenting programmes across the UK. Education The Trust is keen to support the improvement of education, particularly for the most disadvantaged children. It funds individual schools, work in schools as well as organisations which aim to improve the school system. Arts and Culture The Trust supports some of the major arts charities in the UK with the aim of expanding education and public access. Medical Care The Trust gives support to hospices to assist those in need of palliative care to improve their quality of life. Former Offenders The Trust believes in helping people who have been in prison improve their lives. It funds work for people leaving prison to help them get a job or housing, as well as support in prison to help them adjust to life outside.
