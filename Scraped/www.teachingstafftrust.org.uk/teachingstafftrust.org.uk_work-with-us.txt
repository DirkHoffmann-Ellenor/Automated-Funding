As a trustee, you’ll play a pivotal role in governance & strategic development. Our History TST took over from SGBI, a charity with a heritage of over 170 years of work assisting educators in financial hardship, in 2017. In 2018 we merged with SOSS, the Society of Schoolmasters and Schoolmistresses (founded in 1797), with whom we’d worked closely for many years. How we work TST is a small charity managed by two people remotely. Our board of trustees oversees the Trust and sets the policies for the support that we work to.
