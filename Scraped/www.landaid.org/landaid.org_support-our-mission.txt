LandAid funds projects and works with businesses from across the UK. Use your partnership for good. Donate your time and expertise to support charities across the UK combatting youth homelessness. There are plenty of ways to get involved and help us in our mission to end youth homelessness. We bring together different parts of the industry to help increase the impact we can make. LandAid’s Build to Rent Pathfinder is designed to unite the property and wider built environment industry to expand the number of vital homes available to young people who are ready for independent living, moving from temporary to safe, affordable housing. StreetSmart works with restaurants and pubs across the UK to raise money for vulnerable and homeless members of their local community by adding a £1 donation to each diner's bill during the months of November and December. Fundraisers up and down the country biked, baked and made a splash for LandAid this year. What will you do?
