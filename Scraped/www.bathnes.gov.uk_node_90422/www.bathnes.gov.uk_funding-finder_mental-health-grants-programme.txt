The James Tudor Foundation’s Mental Health Grant programme is designed to support UK registered charities operating at a regional or national level that are helping children and young people recovering from Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and parents affected by ACEs, mental illness or addiction. Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are defined as “potentially traumatic events or chronic stressors that occur before the age of 18 and are uncontrollable to the child”. They include the following: Sexual abuse. Physical abuse or neglect. Emotional abuse or neglect. Living in a household where there is domestic violence. Living with a parent with substance abuse. Living with a parent who has a mental illness. Losing a parent through death, abandonment, or divorce, and/or Having a parent in prison. Grants of up to £25,000 over 12-months (occasionally for up to 3 years), with no matched funding requirement, are available for evidence-based, trauma-informed interventions designed to overcome and prevent the trauma of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). The programme works on several levels, supporting both children and young people affected by ACEs, as well as supporting parents to help break the cycle of trauma across generations. The Foundation’s two areas of support are: Support for children and young people - under this focus, the Foundation wants to partner with charities that solely support children and young people who have suffered one or more ACEs, and they do so through evidence-based, trauma-informed therapies.
