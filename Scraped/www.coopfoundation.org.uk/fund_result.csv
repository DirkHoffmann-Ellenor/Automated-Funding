Young Gamechangers Fund: for groups/orgs with income <£100k; Future Communities Fund: long-term, unrestricted funding.","Some funds (e.g., Young Gamechangers Fund) restrict to organisations with annual income under £100,000; Current funding rounds are closed; Focus on youth-led or youth-focused work; Future Communities Fund round two focused on youth justice system experience",closed,Not applicable (no open funds currently),"The Foundation prioritises youth-led, youth-focused, and community-based organisations, especially those supporting marginalised or underrepresented young people. Some funds are only for organisations with income below £100,000. No explicit exclusion of hospices, but current funding priorities do not directly align with palliative care or hospice services unless work is youth-led and fits the fund's focus.",Low Match,"1. Geographic scope is UK-wide, which includes Kent, and applicant types include charities and community organisations, so ellenor Hospice meets these basic criteria. 2. However, all current funding rounds (Future Communities Fund, Young Gamechangers Fund) are closed: 'There are currently no funds open for applications.' 3. The main beneficiary focus is on young people, especially those with experience of the youth justice system, youth activism, and marginalised youth. 4. The Young Gamechangers Fund restricts applications to organisations with annual income under £100,000, while ellenor Hospice's income is £8.2M, making it ineligible for this fund. 5. There are no explicit exclusions of hospices or healthcare charities, but the Foundation's current strategy and open funds do not directly support palliative care or hospice services unless the work is youth-led and fits the specific focus areas. 6. Funding amounts are suitable, but the application status is closed and the thematic focus is not a strong match. Overall, ellenor Hospice is a low match for current Co-op Foundation funding due to closed application windows, income restrictions, and a focus on youth-led, youth justice, and marginalised youth work rather than hospice or palliative care.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:36:20,
