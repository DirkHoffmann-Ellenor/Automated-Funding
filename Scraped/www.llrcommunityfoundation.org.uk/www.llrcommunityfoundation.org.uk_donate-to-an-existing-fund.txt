Voluntary Action South Leicestershire Carers Club funded by The Meggitt Fund This page is for people who would like to donate to an existing grant-giving fund, rather than set up their own grant-giving fund. Some donor funds welcome donations: just use the dropdown box below to find the Fund you wish to donate to and follow the steps. If you’re not ready to set up your own named grant-giving fund, you can still make a donation to the Making Local Life Better Fund , open all year to local charitable groups to apply for anything they need to help others, up to £3000. All applications are fully assessed and approved. There are often more applications than even our donors can fully fund, so your contribution really helps. We can’t report back or name you individually, as we do with our donors’ grant-giving funds, but you can see on our website the fully audited summary of all grants . And you can be sure that 90% of your donation will go to local charities. 10% helps us cover operating costs – and we can claim Gift Aid (on any eligible donation) which covers the 10%, plus adds to the value of your donation to local needs. Just click Donations to the Making Local Life Better Fund (spend down) in the dropdown box below and follow the steps. Your donation will be added to the spend down fund to make grants in the year. If you would like to set up an endowed fund, please do get in touch. If you want to make a donation and you don’t have Paypal, please contact us and we can direct you to an alternative.
