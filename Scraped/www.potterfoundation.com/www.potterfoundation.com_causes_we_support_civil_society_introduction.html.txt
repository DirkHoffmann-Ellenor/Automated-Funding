We are also interested in work that looks at the impact of drones on human rights work, investigative journalism, the rule of law, and democracy and inequality. In order for education to flourish it needs to be underpinned by a strong civil society. We look to support organisations that look to address questions of power, inequality and lack of voice. This is a broad area and our primary focus will be on transparency, accountability, anti-corruption and good governance. We are also interested in human rights, drones, investigative journalism, the rule of law, democracy, citizenship, equality, and the misuse of natural resources. We are generally looking to fund UK based organisations that look at these issues in a global context, for example, which are cross border or non-geographic. Due to our limited resources we are unable to fund grants any in other countries. We do not provide funds for local issues or civic education / citizenship education programmes.
