Applications are via general or fund-specific forms. Funding is competitive and not all eligible projects are funded.",Not Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity providing palliative and end-of-life care, which matches the applicant type and beneficiary focus. However, the Cambridgeshire Community Foundation's grants are for projects delivered within Cambridgeshire, and ellenor Hospice is based in Gravesend, Kent, serving Dartford, Gravesham, Swanley, and Bexley. The guidance states: 'We support projects delivered within Cambridgeshire by national organisations, as long as the funding is restricted to this area of benefit. A very small number of our funds accept applications from outside Cambridgeshire.' There is no evidence that ellenor Hospice delivers services in Cambridgeshire or could restrict funding to that area. Therefore, ellenor Hospice is not eligible for the vast majority of funds, and eligibility for the 'very small number' of funds accepting out-of-area applications is not substantiated. Geographic scope is the key exclusion.",14,14,2025-10-15 12:33:01,
