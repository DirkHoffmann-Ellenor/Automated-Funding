EVENTS Tuesday 15th May Winning Silver at the Charity Film Awards Over 65,000 members of the public voted and help get us shortlisted for the Charity Film Awards Finals and we are thrilled to announce we won a Silver Award for our film; Ending Blindness in Bihar. Simon Burton, Co-Founder of the Charity Film Awards said; “Congratulations Savitri Trust for winning Silver at this year’s Charity Film Awards. Their film, described by one of our judges as ‘incredible content’, was chosen not only by our expert panel of judges but also by the public and to have won silver is an incredible achievement!” We are super proud of our first award and want to thank the talented team at RAW LDN for capturing our work on blindness, so beautifully. The film, shot in Bihar India, follows the journey of Belvanti and her three blind daughters as they travel across the state to receive free cataract surgery. Each year Savitri commit to fund at least 25,000 free surgeries so that families in rural Bihar, with little or no access to eye health, receive the treatment they require to restore their sight and with it, their hopes for a brighter future.
