Our values We fund work that supports the autonomy, liberty and civil rights of autistic, neurodivergent and Disabled people. Our work is framed by the social model of disability. We uphold the principle of “nothing about us without us.” We fund work that supports the civil rights and personal safety of trans people. Trans and non-binary people exist and their identities are real. We respect people’s gender identities and we expect people we work with to do the same. This is especially important to us as neurodiversity and gender diversity often overlap. Structural racism is real and harmful. We aim to become an anti-racist organisation. We support work to challenge racial inequality. We minimise harm to the environment resulting from our work.
