Strengthening Support Systems for our Blue Light Community Established in 2022, the Blue Light Card Foundation exists to give back to those who dedicate their careers to keeping England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales safe, healthy, and supported. We champion the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of the entire Blue Light Community—across health, emergency, social care, and armed forces—recognising the vital role they play in our society every day. Our vision A future where every member of the Blue Light community, both past and present, feels empowered, supported and heard. Every day, we rely on the skills and selfless dedication of the Blue Light community to keep us safe, healthy, and protected. But we know first-hand there aren’t enough ways to recognise all that they do for us. The Blue Light Card Foundation is our way of doing that – championing their wellbeing, so that they know how much they’re valued. By being there for them, they can continue being there for us. Our mission We want every member of the Blue Light community to know that they have support, and to know where to find it in there time of need. We fund projects across the UK to provide those that deal with the most challenging situations with quality resources, connected environments, and places that support their wellbeing Our purpose The Blue Light Card Foundation exists to increase resilience, enable potential and improve life circumstances for the Blue Light community. We’re committed to giving back to those who dedicate much of their lives to keeping us safe. We believe a key part of this is collaborating with life-enhancing projects that provide the Blue Light community with experiences and environments that positively impact their wellbeing.
