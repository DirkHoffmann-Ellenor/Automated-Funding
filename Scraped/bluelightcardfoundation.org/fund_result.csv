Applications are decided quarterly when open.",Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity providing hospice and palliative care, employing NHS and social care staff and volunteers, which aligns with the Blue Light Card Foundation's definition of the Blue Light community (explicitly includes NHS, social care, care home, and health sector staff). The Foundation funds UK-wide, including Kent. Grants are up to £25,000, suitable for ellenor's scale. Previous grants have been made to hospices (e.g., Mary Stevens Hospice, Saint Catherine’s Hospice) for staff and volunteer wellbeing initiatives, confirming hospices are eligible. However, the funding is restricted to projects that directly benefit Blue Light staff/volunteers (not patients/families), and applications are currently closed with no open deadline. No restrictions exclude hospices, but the current application window is not open. Therefore, ellenor Hospice is 'Eligible' (not 'Highly Eligible') due to the closed status, but should monitor for the next round as it is a strong match when open.",15,15,2025-10-15 10:33:34,
