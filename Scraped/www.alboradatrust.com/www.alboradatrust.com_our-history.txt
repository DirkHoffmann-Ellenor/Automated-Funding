A Legacy of Excellence Inception of The ALBORADA Trust The ALBORADA Trust's remit spans a wide range of causes, the legacy of Alborada remains an essential part of its identity, reflected in its notable support of veterinary research and animal welfare and its special interest in funding community causes in the town of Newmarket. ​ The ALBORADA Trust was established in 2001 by philanthropist and distinguished breeder Kirsten Rausing. Its name pays homage to her exceptional race mare, Alborada, a British Thoroughbred known for her speed, stamina, and competitive spirit. Who We Are Today Today, The Trust's goal of supporting a diverse range of causes and sectors with an open and needs-based approach has been realised. 2024 was another exceptional year for the ALBORADA Trust. The Trust provided grants to a diverse group of national and international charities, some of whom are working in the most extreme conditions to deliver humanitarian aid and international development to people in dire need. The Trust’s remit allows the Trustees to be agile in their collective decision-making whilst making difficult decisions about where to allocate finite resources. This year the Trust said thank you to Larry Pillard, who gave the Trust many years of dedicated and valued service as a Trustee and welcomed Professor Jane Clarke to the role.
