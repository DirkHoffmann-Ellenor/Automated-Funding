Projects outside London (UK) or Sub-Saharan Africa are not eligible.",Not Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity and provides medical care to vulnerable groups, which aligns with the fund's beneficiary focus. However, the Peter Stebbings Memorial Charity explicitly states: 'In the U.K., we only support projects taking place in London, unless the charity’s work is known to the Trust.' ellenor Hospice operates in Kent (Gravesend, Dartford, etc.), not London, and there is no indication that the Trust knows the organisation. Additionally, the fund generally assists charities with annual incomes up to £5m, while ellenor Hospice's income is £8.2m. Therefore, ellenor Hospice is not eligible due to both geographic and income restrictions.
