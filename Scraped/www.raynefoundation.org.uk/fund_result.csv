For core costs, annual grant size should not exceed 10% of annual income. High unrestricted reserves (>9 months) may reduce eligibility. Must show impact beyond local level and share learning. Priority is for projects, not ongoing core service delivery.",Possibly Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a UK-registered charity based in Kent, serving children, young people, adults, and families with palliative and end-of-life care. The Rayne Foundation funds UK-based voluntary/not-for-profit organisations, including charities, and its geographic scope includes Kent. However, funding is strictly for innovative projects that benefit one of three priority groups: children and young people (especially care-experienced or with mental health needs), refugees/asylum seekers, or people in later life and their carers. ellenor’s work with children, young people, and people in later life could fit, but only if the project is innovative, has potential for wider application, and is not simply continuation of core services. The Foundation does not fund day-to-day running costs or business-as-usual local services, which is a significant restriction for hospices. There is no explicit exclusion of hospices, but the focus on innovation and wider impact, plus the requirement for match-funding and limits on core cost grants, means eligibility depends on the specific project proposed. No deadline; applications are rolling. Overall, ellenor Hospice is 'Possibly Eligible' if it can propose an innovative project aligned with the Foundation’s priority groups and criteria.",14,14,2025-10-15 12:49:38,
