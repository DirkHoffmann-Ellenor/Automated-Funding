Only organisations (not individuals) may apply. Most local funding is restricted to Birmingham and the surrounding area; national work must influence policy/practice at the UK level. Social investments require income generation and alignment with social justice aims.,Not Eligible,"1.

Ellenor Hospice is based in Kent, not Birmingham, and its work is not described as national policy/practice influencing. 2. Beneficiary focus: The Trust funds work in social justice areas (criminal, gender, racial, economic justice), not health, palliative care, or hospice services. 3. Restrictions: 'We do not accept unsolicited applications for work outside the UK.' and 'The geographical restrictions in each of our programmes is different, please read the programme guidance carefully.' 4. No explicit mention of hospices, palliative care, or health sector as eligible. 5. Social investment is available UK-wide but only for projects that generate income and align with social justice aims, not for core hospice/palliative care delivery. Conclusion: Ellenor Hospice does not fit the geographic or thematic priorities, and is therefore not eligible.",14,14,2025-10-15 12:30:29,
