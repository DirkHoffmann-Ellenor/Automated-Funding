Application process The Foundation is a small organisation with a small team. To manage our resources effectively, we do not accept unsolicited applications. We meet and get to know excellent organisations and individuals first, and we invite applications from those that align best with our strategy. If you support disadvantaged young people and meet our eligibility criteria, we’ll be glad to get to know you. Our full process – from a first conversation through to making a grant – is set out below: Gathering information: we research and listen to young people Developing a relationship: we meet and get to know excellent organisations and individuals Inviting an application: we invite applications from the organisations and individuals that align best with our strategy Assessing objectively: we use a scorecard to assess applications objectively - and - each application is assessed by two team members independently Trustees decide: the Foundation’s Trustees consider funding applications every quarter – all decisions are at their complete discretion Agreeing accessible terms: we agree easy-to-understand terms and conditions for every grant
