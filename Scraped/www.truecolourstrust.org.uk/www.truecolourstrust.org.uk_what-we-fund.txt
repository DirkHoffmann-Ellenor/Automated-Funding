What We Fund True Colours awards grants amounting to approximately Â£2 million each year. This funding is split across our programmes in the UK and Africa. The majority of our grants are awarded to fund programmes or projects which have been designed and developed in collaboration with our partners. Our Major Programmes are often large, multi-year strategic pieces of work designed by True Colours following consultation with the sector. These grants are normally intended to result in systemic change in a particular area. Our project grants might include funding for an organisationâs core costs; support to help an organisation build its capacity in some way; funding towards research projects or support for service delivery. We also run two small grants programmes which have an open application process â one for work in the UK and another for work in Africa. We do not encourage unsolicited applications, except via our small grants programmes, as they are unlikely to be successful. If you are unsure whether to apply, we would encourage you to get in touch before submitting an application.
