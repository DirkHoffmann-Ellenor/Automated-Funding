Camden is one of London’s most unequal boroughs. A 7-year gap in life expectancy and child poverty rates of 43% show just how stark the divide is. Many face barriers to housing, work, and healthcare. Camden Giving’s mission is to end local poverty and inequality in Camden, and thanks to our supporters, we’re investing in community-led solutions that challenge the root causes and build long-term change. Creating a More Connected Camden where every citizen has the tools, power and connections to overcome inequality. £7.1m 1,057 382 1,000+
