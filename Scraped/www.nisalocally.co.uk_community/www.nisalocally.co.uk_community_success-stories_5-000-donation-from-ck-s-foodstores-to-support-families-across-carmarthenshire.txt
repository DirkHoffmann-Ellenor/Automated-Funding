Home Community Success Stories £5,000 donation from CK’s Foodstores to support families across Carmarthenshire £5,000 donation from CK’s Foodstores to support families across Carmarthenshire CK’s Supermarkets’ Carmarthenshire stores have donated £5,000 through Co-op Wholesale’s Making a Difference Locally (MADL) charity to support the Carmarthenshire Action Squad. The donation will sponsor the Action Squad’s upcoming charity ball, which raises vital funds for Action for Children to support hundreds of families across Carmarthenshire and the surrounding area. A portion of the donation will also go to Sandy Bear Children’s Bereavement Charity, helping even more families facing challenging circumstances. Funds raised through MADL come from the sale of Co-op own-brand products in Co-op Wholesale-affiliated stores, with a percentage of every purchase contributing to a virtual fund for each store to support local causes. Christopher Kelly, owner of CK’s Supermarkets said: “We’re really proud to support such an important cause in our local community. "This donation will contribute towards the band and entertainment for the evening, but the bulk of it will go directly into the charity pot to help families right here in Carmarthenshire. "The Action Squad does incredible work through Action for Children, and we’re pleased to be a part of that.” Kate Carroll, Social Value Lead at Co-op Wholesale, added: “CK’s Supermarkets are long-standing champions of their community, and this latest donation is another brilliant example of how local retail can have a lasting positive impact. "More than £170,000 has now been raised by CK’s through MADL, which is an outstanding contribution to good causes across the communities they serve.” The Carmarthenshire Action Squad was set up to help families in the county supported by Action for Children, and the charity ball is a key fundraiser that brings the local community together for a night of celebration and generosity.
