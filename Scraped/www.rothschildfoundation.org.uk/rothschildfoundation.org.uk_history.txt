One of these, The Alice Trust, had as its mission the preservation, protection and improvement of Waddesdon Manor in the Vale of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire for the benefit of the public. The Foundation continues this commitment, supporting and devoting a considerable portion of its funding to the restoration, preservation, improvement and development of the Manor, its collection and estate. Waddesdon today represents a centre for excellence in the fields of arts and heritage, conservation and horticulture with a developing focus on sustainable environmental practice. This informs the wider activity of the Foundation which includes support of the cultural sector and environmental causes locally and across the UK. The Rothschild family have a long tradition of supporting the community local to Waddesdon. This inspires an important part of our work to this day, delivered through our grant funding for the local charity sector. Underpinning our interest in the arts and humanities, the environment and social welfare is a commitment to increasing access to opportunity and supporting people to realise their potential. The formation of the Rothschild Foundation formalised the Rothschild family commitment to being a good neighbour The Rothschild Foundation Windmill Hill Silk Street Waddesdon HP18 0JZ Find us on: Career opportunities Contact us Privacy policy All Rights Reserved Â© The Rothschild Foundation Registered Charity No 1138145 Registered Company No 7350078
