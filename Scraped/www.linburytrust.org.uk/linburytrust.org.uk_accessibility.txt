Here are some of the features to help you use this site: Images in the gallery have Alt text description. Most links will open in your existing browser window, enabling you to use your browser back to navigate. You should be able to change the size of the text in your web browser menu, or alternatively if your mouse has a scroll wheel you can hold down the CTRL key whilst moving the scroll wheel forwards (text gets larger) or backwards (text gets smaller). Due to using a black background throughout the site, the contrast rating for all text is very high which should make it easier to read. The Ability Net website ( Simple ‘how to’ guides to make your device easier to use | My Computer My Way (abilitynet.org.uk) ) has further information on how to adapt your phone, tablet, or computer to meet your needs.
