0117 959 6496 grants@jamestudor.org.uk Living Wage Funder As a Living Wage Employer and a Living Wage Funder, we support and encourage fair pay in the charity sector LIVING WAGE FUNDERS A fair day's pay for a hard day's work The James Tudor Foundation is an accredited Living Wage Employer and a Living Wage Funde r, and proud to be part of the movement to tackle low pay in the charity sector. The real Living Wage is voluntarily paid by over 16,000 UK organisations who believe their staff deserve a fair day's pay for a hard day's work. It is the only UK wage rate based on the cost of living. The current rates are £12.60/hour outside London and £13.85/hour in London, and the new rates are announced every October. Our funding is flexible and is rarely tied to a specific post, but we encourage all applicants to pay all their staff - regardless or role type or seniority - the real Living Wage as a minimum. Indeed, many of the charities that approach us are already doing so, but have never sought accreditation. That was us, too. If that's you, please consider becoming an accredited Living Wage Employer so that you can help to spread the word about the importance of fair pay in our sector. As a funder that supports both physical and mental health , raising awareness of the Living Wage Employer scheme is especially aligned with our mission. However, Living Wage Employer accreditation is not required for charities to apply to or be awarded a grant from The James Tudor Foundation , and accreditation status plays no role in our assessment of the applications we receive. When you are ready to do so, you'll find the process of applying for accreditation both quick and easy, and the Living Wage Foundation team are there to support you all the way. You can find more information about becoming a Living Wage Employer here , and you can apply for accreditation on the Living Wage Foundation website .
