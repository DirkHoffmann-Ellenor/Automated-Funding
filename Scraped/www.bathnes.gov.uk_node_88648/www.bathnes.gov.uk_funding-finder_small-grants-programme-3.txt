Previously the Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation, the King Charles III Charitable Fund is primarily a grant-making organisation, providing both Large and Small grants programmes. The Trustees oversee all grant-making, awarding grants across the following 6 funding themes, with projects serving disadvantaged communities most likely to be prioritised for grant support: Countryside – investing in the economic and environmental future of the countryside. This includes grants to support sustainable and regenerative agriculture, nature friendly farming practices and a brighter future for those who live and work in rural communities (usually defined as having a population of less than 10,000). Education – supporting education, training and employability opportunities through which young people and adults can fulfil their potential. This includes grants to non-profit organisations working to narrow the attainment gap, support broader education through music, the arts, sports and outdoor pursuits, as well as investing in teachers continuing professional development. Environment – protecting and promoting the natural world through efforts including habitat restoration, species conservation, carbon savings and sequestration and circular economies. Health and Wellbeing – improving the health and wellbeing of people and communities. Grants have enabled people with disabilities, those facing life limiting illnesses and people from disadvantaged and marginalised communities to benefit from improved physical and mental health. Heritage and Conservation – the preservation of historic and culturally important buildings and traditional craftmanship, together with the sustainable regeneration of communities and the built environment across the globe, and Social Inclusion – promoting social inclusion for vulnerable and marginalised communities through projects that relieve poverty, loneliness and other social issues. Grants of up to £3,000 are available each year for a period of up to 3 years for grassroots, community-based projects with a total project cost of less than £50,000. Grants should primarily be used to cover project costs, although some funding can be put towards core and salary costs providing these are part of the project in question.
