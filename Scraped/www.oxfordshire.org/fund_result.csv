OCF grants are for organisations delivering services in Oxfordshire. Some referenced funds (e.g., Ann Rylands, Barchester, National Lottery) are external and may have broader eligibility, but OCF's own funds are Oxfordshire-focused.",Not Eligible,"1. OCF's own grant programmes are explicitly for 'charitable groups across Oxfordshire' and 'projects that enhance mental health, build rural skills and expand access to green spaces – especially for those who face barriers to enjoying the natural environment' in Oxfordshire. 2. The Thriving in Nature Fund, Step Change Fund, and other OCF-managed grants all specify Oxfordshire as the geographic focus. 3. While some external funds listed (e.g., Ann Rylands, Barchester, National Lottery) may be open to Kent-based charities, these are not OCF's own funds and would require separate applications. 4. There is no indication that OCF funds are available to organisations operating solely in Kent. 5. Therefore, ellenor Hospice, which operates in Kent and not Oxfordshire, is not eligible for OCF's own grant programmes.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:47:06,
