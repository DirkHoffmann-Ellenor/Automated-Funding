Most grants are to Jewish charities, but non-Jewish organisations are considered.",Possibly Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity, which matches the applicant type. The Trust's main focus is Jewish charities in North West England or Israel, but it does consider applications from non-Jewish organisations and from other UK regions, though with a lower chance of success ('we do make grants to non-Jewish organisations and...outside of this area'). The geographic scope technically includes Kent, but it is not a priority. The Trust supports community care and social services, which could encompass hospice and palliative care, but these are not explicitly mentioned. Applications are currently closed and will reopen January 1, 2026. There are no explicit exclusions for hospices, but the low priority for non-Jewish, non-North West charities and the lack of explicit mention of palliative care reduce the match.
