Apply The Peter Sowerby Foundation actively solicits applications from charities, community groups and registered healthcare providers for projects that meet our trustees’ priorities. This means that we do not accept unsolicited applications for grants. However, if you have an idea for a project that is closely aligned with the Foundation’s aims and priorities you can get in touch with us through our contact page . Please submit a brief synopsis of your project, including a summary budget and proposed timeline for us to consider. We cannot respond to all the ideas we are sent, but we do read all proposals and get in touch with those we feel could be a good fit.
