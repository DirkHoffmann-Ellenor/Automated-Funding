Home Community Success Stories Maltesers and MADL launch £10,000 fund to support local women’s causes Maltesers and MADL launch £10,000 fund to support local women’s causes Making a Difference Locally (MADL), the charity of Co-op Wholesale, has teamed up with Maltesers UK (Mars) to launch a £10,000 community fund aimed at supporting women across the UK. The initiative will provide 20 donations of up to £500 to local causes that empower and uplift women aged 18 and over. From grassroots sports teams and menopause cafés to mental health projects and domestic abuse support groups, a wide range of organisations will be eligible. Customers are invited to nominate deserving causes at participating Co-op Wholesale partnered stores, giving them a chance to receive much-needed funding to continue their important work. Kate Carroll, Social Value Lead at Co-op Wholesale, said: “We’re thrilled to be partnering with Maltesers on this campaign to support women in communities up and down the country. “Whether it’s promoting wellbeing, providing a safe space, or championing equality, these local groups are often the beating heart of their communities. This funding could make a real difference in helping them continue their vital work.” The campaign reflects MADL’s ongoing commitment to building stronger communities through locally driven giving, and supports Maltesers’ mission to break down stigmas and improve women’s wellbeing - especially around maternal mental health and gender inequality. Nominations are now open and can be made in participating Nisa stores. Customers are encouraged to act quickly to shine a spotlight on the women’s initiatives that matter most in their local area.
