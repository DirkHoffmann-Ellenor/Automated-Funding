National Portrait Gallery – Access Programme Report: Summer 2025 “Thank you for your loyal support. With your continued commitment, we are building a truly inclusive National Portrait Gallery where every visitor can belong. “Following our major transformation project Inspiring People, we reopened in June 2023 with reimagined galleries, expansive new learning spaces, and a renewed mission to engage with our diverse audiences more deeply. Since reopening 2.8 million people and 65,000 schoolchildren have visited, giving a new generation a chance connect with art and history in ways that feel inspiring and relevant. 4,000 people take part in activities every month, a 200% increase. “Just as vital is the work we do to ensure everyone can take part, including those who are often excluded. We are committed to making portraiture relevant, powerful and accessible for all. We’ve welcomed over 322,000 disabled visitors, a 131% increase from before closure, showing how our changes are breaking down barriers and making the Gallery a place where more people feel they belong. We have also trained 240 staff and 146 volunteers in disability awareness and inclusive practice.” Read the full report here .
