The Foundation will not make a general call for research grants but will pro-actively identify partners and issues it wishes to fund. We have agreed a broad approach to these grants. Firstly, the research/policy grants will be national projects and be identified and overseen (and sometimes directly delivered) by the Alex Ferry Foundation staff. Secondly, these research and policy grants projects will tend towards longer term issues, potentially with greater impact and profile. Thirdly, the output of research or policy may have a dissemination and/or advocacy element with partners. more about the research work we support.
