In September 2021 our trustees awarded the first set of grants under JLF’s funding priorities for the period April 2021 to March 2022. Our priorities focus on supporting children and young people aged 16 to 25 who are experiencing loss and disadvantage as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and its effects. We particularly wish to support services and activities of a practical kind (e.g. mentoring, sport, etc.) supporting young people’s mental health and wellbeing and providing opportunities for them to fulfil their potential. Four organisations have each been awarded £30,000 as core funding to support their work with young people. The organisations are: The Change Foundation - delivering targeted long-term interventions for vulnerable young people through Coach Mentors with lived experience, providing regular sport, personalised mentoring and work-related opportunities. In2Out - supporting young people leaving custody to resettle into society by providing life-skills training, mentoring and ongoing support. Sport 4 Life UK - supporting young people to move into sustained education, training and work through sports-themed personal development. Transitions UK - supporting vulnerable young people who are experiencing personal disadvantage through transition support services, including mentoring and life-skills coaching. Our trustees chose these organisations through a proactive process. Following initial research, we invited the organisations to send brief proposals for how a grant from JLF would support their work. We are looking forward to learning from these organisations over the coming year. You can find out more about our current funding priorities by clicking here .
