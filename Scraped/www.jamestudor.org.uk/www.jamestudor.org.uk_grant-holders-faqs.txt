Can I apply as a current grant holder? We do accept applications for continuation funding; however, we do not award concurrent grants. This means that if you currently hold a grant, any new grant awarded would commence only after the conclusion of your existing grant period. For example, if you were awarded a grant in June 2025, the earliest payment for a new grant would be in June 2026. To align with this timeline, you must submit your Expression of Interest by the relevant deadline. Grant round schedules can be found on the funding programme page for each programme. Please also check the answers in the How often can I apply? and When can I apply? sections on the Applicants FAQs page.

If everything is going well and you’re not facing any difficulties, simply tick the box to confirm – there’s no need to provide any further information.
