The Foundation hosts occasional informational and fundraising events to raise awareness of its aims, activities and accomplishments. The Foundation has, for 15+ years, hosted a charity golf and celebration event that invites individuals and corporations to support its work. In 2020, The Foundation will hold its 20th anniversary Black Heart Foundation Charity Golf Championship and Celebration. This by invitation only event has become one of the premier charity golf celebrations in Europe and has been chaired by some legends of the sport. The Foundation’s charity golf events provide our partners, benefactors and guests an opportunity to meet and hear from many of the young men and ladies who have benefited from the Foundation’s support.
