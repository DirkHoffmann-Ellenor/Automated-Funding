Safe sustainable water for all We work with rural communities to help them secure a sustainable source of clean water all year round. Having worked in northwest India we’re now excitingly expanding in sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1987 our high impact work has reached over 2 million people in 2,000 villages, harvesting 1.2 billion litres of rainwater annually. We believe water is the key to stepping out of poverty, and the way we work provides lasting impact. Using a range of highly effective simple water harvesting methods, tried and tested over many years we get water to where it is needed for families, schools and communities with all the follow-on benefits water brings: Less drudgery for women and girls fetching water daily, better health, improved educational opportunities, stronger communities, income security and increased resilience to climate change. Since 2015 WaterHarvest has benefited from support by The Shears Foundation, enabling us to achieve so much. The wonderful multi-year grants helped us plan ahead and develop new projects. Thanks to the Shears Foundation committing to us we were able to tell people that help was on its way.
