Skip to primary navigation Skip to main content Grants One of Beaverbrook’s greatest legacies, the Beaverbrook Foundation was set up under his direction as a grant-making organisation structured to monitor and continue gifts after his death. Funds are distributed to many areas, often focusing on charities and causes that reflect Beaverbrook’s own interests. Over 1,000 different charitable organisations have received grants over the last 60 years. The Foundation’s funds are fully committed so no new applications are currently being accepted.
