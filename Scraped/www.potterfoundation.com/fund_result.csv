Only 10% of grants are for non-strategic causes (e.g., arts, health, MS Society). Must email to discuss potential eligibility before invitation. Hospice/palliative care is not a stated focus, but some health-related grants have been made under non-strategic giving.",Possibly Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity and located within the UK, which matches the applicant type and geographic scope. However, the Foundation's main focus is on Education and Civil Society (primarily human rights, governance, and education policy), and it explicitly states that only 10% of grants are for non-strategic causes, which occasionally include health charities (e.g., MS Society, Macmillan Cancer Relief, St. John's Hospice, Teenage Cancer Trust, Prostate Cancer Charity, British Heart Foundation, Sick Children's Trust). There is no explicit exclusion of hospices or palliative care, but these are not a core focus and are only supported under non-strategic, discretionary giving. Applications are strictly by invitation only, and unsolicited applications are not accepted. The Foundation requests that potential applicants email to discuss eligibility, but there is no guarantee of invitation. Funding amounts are suitable, and there is precedent for health-related grants, but the match is tangential and highly discretionary. Therefore, ellenor Hospice is Possibly Eligible, but only for non-strategic, discretionary funding and only if invited to apply.",14,14,2025-10-15 12:48:55,
