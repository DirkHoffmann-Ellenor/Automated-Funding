Apply How to Apply We welcome applications for funding in our five focus areas from eligible organisations. Please bear in mind that applications will generally exceed our capacity for funding and given our limited staff resources we will not be able to enter into discussion of the reasons if you are rejected. We may contact you for further details if needed and if you are successful we will make the first payment within 4 months of the acceptance. Please do not contact individual Trustees about your request unless we ask you to do so. We are a small team of four trustees and one employee and will review applications twice a year in April and October. Please submit your application in either March or September using the online form. If there is a reason you cannot access this or need an alternative way of applying please contact us for further advice. We may occasionally fund organisations or projects outside our focus areas. If you wish to apply for such a grant we suggest you contact us before making an application to ascertain whether it will be considered. Please complete all sections of the application concisely. If we need further information we will request it. Our Treasurer will advise you in due course whether your application has been successful or not and when you may expect the first payment.
