I want to set up a Memorial Fund The Community Foundation manages several funds that have been set up in memory of a family member or friend. We work to your pace – as quickly or as slowly as you wish. We can help your Fund to take donations from others, immediately and/or in the long term. You can name the Fund and choose to benefit an area or a local need that was important to the person who has gone, or is important to you. Some memorial fund holders prefer to remain minimally connected, with the Community Foundation managing the fund for them in perpetuity, reporting back annually – or less frequently if wished. Others like to be more involved and make decisions about where grants from the fund should go. Either way, you can alter the name or direction of the memorial fund at any time. If you would like to talk about the possibility of setting up a memorial fund with the Community Foundation, contact Katy.green@llrcommunityfoundation.org.uk
