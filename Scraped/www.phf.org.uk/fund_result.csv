Both funds are open to charities but have strong thematic and operational requirements.",Not Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity providing palliative and end-of-life care, including for young people. However, the Paul Hamlyn Foundation Youth Fund explicitly states it 'will not fund work that is focused on young people receiving hospice or end of life care.' The Migration Fund is open to charities but is focused on organisations led by and for migrants/diaspora communities, prioritising those with turnover under £500,000 and only funds service delivery if it is directly linked to addressing root causes of injustice for migrants/diaspora. ellenor Hospice’s core activities are direct palliative care and bereavement support, not systemic change or migrant justice. Therefore, both main open funds exclude ellenor Hospice’s core work either by explicit restriction (Youth Fund) or by thematic mismatch (Migration Fund). No other open funds at PHF are relevant to hospice/palliative care. Applications are open and funding amounts are suitable, but explicit exclusions and thematic misalignment make ellenor Hospice not eligible.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:48:35,
