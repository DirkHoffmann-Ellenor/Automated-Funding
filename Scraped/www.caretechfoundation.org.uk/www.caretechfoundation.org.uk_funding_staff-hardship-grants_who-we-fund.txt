Staff Hardship Fund Providing small grants to CareTech staff and those who may recently have left the company who find themselves in significant financial hardship or in, or at, serious risk of becoming in significant financial hardship. The Staff Hardship Fund is for CareTech staff and for those who have recently left the company. It is for those who are struggling to cope financially and are in, or at risk, of serious financial hardship. It is not a loan that needs to be repaid nor does it count as an advance on your wages. It is to make day-to-day living more affordable and/or to cover unexpected costs.
