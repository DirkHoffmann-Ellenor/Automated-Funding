EXCEPTIONAL GRANTS (grants awarded over £500,000) Occasionally, the Foundation makes exceptional grants (normally capital), above the maximum grant awarded through the Main Grants Scheme . An exceptional grant will only be considered, where, for example, an overriding factor is that the project will not occur without the Foundation grant or where the project is of national importance. Exceptional grants are rare, and should be discussed with the Chief Executive before an application is made.
