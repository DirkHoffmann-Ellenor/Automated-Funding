Apply for funding & support Routes Out of Homelessness Grant Programmes In this section LandAid offer different grants and funding opportunities for charities across the UK with a focus on supporting 16-25 year olds who are, have been or are at risk of experiencing homelessness. We usually offer three core grant programmes. They are each linked to the provision of a different type of bedspace as defined by the Positive Pathway which recognises three distinct types of accommodation: Emergency, Supported, and Independent (see diagram below). Each of these is an important element of a holistic approach to provision, but none of them are enough on their own. For that reason we seek to fund the following grants across the UK: Safe Places Programme: To create new/additional hosting bedspaces , generally bedspaces in the homes of individuals or families who may be volunteers or paid. These bedspaces would generally be used for emergency housing , or as a form of supported housing. Capital Grants Programme: To create bedspaces in properties owned by, or on a long-term lease to charitable organisations . These bedspaces could be used for emergency , supported or move-on accommodation . Move-on Grants Programme: To unlock bedspaces in the private, or social, rental sector . These bedspaces will be for move-on accommodation. These grants would be for charities working with young people who are ready and wanting to move forward into independent living, but face barriers in accessing rental accommodation.
