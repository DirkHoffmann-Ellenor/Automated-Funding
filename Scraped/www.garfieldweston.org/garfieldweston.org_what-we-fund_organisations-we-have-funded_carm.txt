Welfare CARM Caring Together on Romney Marsh For over 60 years the Foundation has valued local charities that provide vital support and community to vulnerable people, the majority of which are small in size but mighty in impact! CARM is a great example of this type of local charity. CARM runs a range of services for older, isolated and lonely people, supported by a team of 140 volunteers. Operating over the whole of Romney Marsh (150 square miles), it supports 600 people a year through in-person and telephone befriending, reminiscence sessions in 20 care homes, and a community allotment to name just a few. The charity measures its impact, with 96% befriending clients reporting an improvement in mood, over 80% feeling less lonely, and 100% of its volunteers feeling valued and would be happy to encourage other to volunteer for CARM. We are so grateful for the grant from Garfield Weston which has helped us to maintain our much needed and loved services during a difficult economic climate. Grants from foundations such as Garfield Weston help form the backbone of small charities, and in our case, has helped enable hundreds of older people to access vital services to reduce loneliness and social isolation operating across our operating area. Helen Mattock, Manager CARMâ€™s application included moving case studies and very supportive testimonials which demonstrated how valued its work is by the local community. The charity operates with a modest budget and works hard to generate funds from a range of sources, including local people, which also helps to raise its profile. CARM had not applied to us before and so we appreciated that it followed our application guidelines and included all the information we needed to make a grant in confidence. Interested in applying?
