We aim to make a real difference when the unexpected happens by reducing the financial impact of bereavement, serious ill health or injury, relationship breakdown, loss of home or loss of income. Our History TST took over from SGBI, a charity with a heritage of over 170 years of work assisting educators in financial hardship, in 2017. In 2018 we merged with SOSS, the Society of Schoolmasters and Schoolmistresses (founded in 1797), with whom we’d worked closely for many years. How we work TST is a small charity managed by two people remotely. Our board of trustees oversees the Trust and sets the policies for the support that we work to.
