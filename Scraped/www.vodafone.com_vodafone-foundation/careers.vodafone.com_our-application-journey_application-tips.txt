Focus on the key skills and experience that are most relevant to the role and dial that up in your own experiences. ü§ñ Ask AI to help identify the key skills or experience from a job advert. Use evidence to show the impact you‚Äôve made as this helps us to see the value you can bring. For example, instead of saying ‚Äúimproved sales,‚Äù say ‚Äúincreased sales by 20% over six months.‚Äù Aim for 1‚Äì2 pages and include relevant information only.

At Vodafone, we look for people who live our Spirit Behaviours, who want to keeping growing their own skills and have the potential to make an impact. ‚ÄãLearn more about our Spirit Behaviours here. Now that you've identified the key skills, think about your own real-life examples and how they match to those. Start by listing out the things you're proud of or have achieved in your career so far.

You'll have an opportunity to ask your own questions which is a great chance to learn more about us and the team you're joining. From the learning tools and growth opportunities available, or the key projects you may be working on in your first year. ü§ñ Ask AI to provide some sample questions that you can tailor to the role. Practising for your interview Once you‚Äôve identified the key skills for the role, researched Vodafone and listed your examples, it‚Äôs time to practice for your your interview. Here‚Äôs how to do it step by step: To support you, we have published some potential questions that you could be asked during your interview. This is a great place to start when drafting your interview answers (Find our Spirit questions here ). Use your examples and build them into structured answers. Some of your examples might work for more than one question, so think about a variety that you can use for different questions asked on the day. ü§ñ Use AI to help draft potential skills based questions based on the job advert. Ensure your drafted questions are using the STAR technique (Situation, Task, Action, Result). This structure helps with providing a clear and effective answer, that showcases the impact you made. ü§ñ Use AI to check that you are covering all elements and gain feedback on what you can improve Whether its by yourself or with a friend , family member , mentor , or coach, practising your answers can really help. Just saying your answers out loud can help you feel more confident and identify areas to improve. Mock interviews can get you accustomed to the interview environment and can help you to memorise your answers. Ask for constructive feedback and consider what worked well, and what could be clearer or stronger? ü§ñ Use AI to review your answers and give you tips to improve. Some tools have voice capability so you can practise out loud and gain feedback on your delivery. Remember , we‚Äôre not looking for perfection ‚Äì we‚Äôre looking for potential, passion, and people who want to grow with us. We want to learn about the real you and set you up for success, so getting AI to generate examples that do not accurately reflect your own skills and experience, could risk your performance in the role if you were offered. Using AI prompts Prompts are how you ask AI to do something for you ‚Äî like creating, summarising, editing, or transforming. Think about prompting like having a conversation, using clear language and providing context like you would when speaking to another person. What response do you want from AI? Why do you need it and who is involved? What information sources or samples should AI use? How should AI respond to best meet your expectations? Here's an example Find me research on the Technological advancements made within the Cyber security industry, to help me prepare for my cyber security lead interview. Focus on finding research from journal articles published within the past 6 months. Please present the research to me in a table format.
