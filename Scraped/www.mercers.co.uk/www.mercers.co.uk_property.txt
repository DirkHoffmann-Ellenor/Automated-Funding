The estate comprises a retail, restaurant, office, and residential portfolio and is known as The Yards. Our property in the City of London is predominately the block bounded by Ironmonger Lane, Old Jewry and Cheapside. The main developments in 2022-2024 have been in Frederick’s Place. The Whittington Building in Frederick's Place, named in recognition of one of the greatest Mercers, Richard Whittington, is near completion. Sustainability has been at the heart of this £40 million project, which has been carefully designed to be environmentally efficient through its consideration of space, heating, and cooling, as well as facilities for occupiers. View a time-lapse development of the building here . View our inaugural Environmental Action Plan which outlines our commitment to reduce CO2e emissions across our property estate, supporting the Paris Agreement (IPCC), and UK Government’s goal to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 ºC. Our new publication - Thread - gives you an insight of what it means to be an occupier with the Mercers' Company estate.
