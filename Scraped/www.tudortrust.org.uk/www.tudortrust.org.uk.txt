Who we are What we do Our funding Our blogs News We advance racial justice by resourcing power in communities. Our vision is for a world as it should be. One that moves away from scarcity towards a just and equitable future. Our story Tudor is a grant-making charity working towards a total asset approach that embraces the strength of our people, culture and relationships, alongside how we invest and redistribute our capital. Change We Seek We believe racial justice is the foundation for building systems that work better for everyone. Systems that hold social, economic and environmental justice at their core.
