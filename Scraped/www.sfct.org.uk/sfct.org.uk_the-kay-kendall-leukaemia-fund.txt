About the Fund Grantmaking process About the Fund Established in 1984 under the Will of the late James Sainsbury CBE, The Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund has awarded research grants on aspects of leukaemia and related haematological malignancies. Awards have been made for fellowships, project grants, and capital builds and have contributed significantly to the progress and body of research in this area. A new programme of patient care and patient centred projects associated with leukaemia and haematological diseases was instigated in 2008 for awards towards capital builds and initiatives with a strong patient-care focus for leukaemia patients, their families, and carers. The Kay Kendall Leukaemia Fund has now completed active grant-making and no longer accepts applications for either of the above programmes.
