Focus is on charities solely supporting children/young people or parents affected by ACEs.,Possibly Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a UK registered charity with an annual income under £20 million and over 5 years of accounts, meeting the basic organisational criteria. However, the James Tudor Foundation Mental Health Grants Programme requires that applicants have a key focus on preventing/reducing the impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and use trauma-informed, evidence-based interventions, with services being actively patient-led. ellenor Hospice provides palliative and end-of-life care, including bereavement support and therapies for children and families, which may overlap with trauma support, but its primary mission is not solely focused on ACEs or trauma prevention. The fund is open and the funding range is suitable. However, unless ellenor can demonstrate that a specific project or service is dedicated to trauma-informed, ACE-focused work (e.g., bereavement support for children affected by ACEs), eligibility is not certain. Therefore, eligibility is rated as 'Possibly Eligible'—a strong case could be made if a relevant, trauma-informed project is proposed, but the core hospice mission is not a direct match for the fund's primary focus.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:30:46,
