The Joseph Levy Foundation only funds organisations that are invited to apply after proactive engagement; unsolicited applications are not accepted ('we do not accept unsolicited applications. We meet and get to know excellent organisations and individuals first, and we invite applications from those that align best with our strategy'). 2. The core eligibility is for organisations 'committed to supporting disadvantaged young people' and the Foundation's mission, priorities, and awarded grants all focus on young people, especially those aged 16-25, experiencing disadvantage, loss, or health conditions. 3. While ellenor Hospice provides some services to children and young people, its primary remit is palliative and end-of-life care for all ages, and its main beneficiary group is broader than the Foundation's focus. 4. The Foundation is based in the UK and funds UK-based organisations, which matches ellenor's location. 5. Funding amounts are suitable, but the invitation-only process and the specific focus on disadvantaged young people (not general hospice or palliative care) make ellenor a low match unless it has a specific, youth-focused project and is proactively approached by JLF. 6. No explicit exclusion of hospices, but the focus and process make eligibility unlikely without invitation and a strong youth focus.",7,7,2025-10-15 12:42:40,
