Ellenor Hospice would only be eligible if applying for a project specifically focused on direct mental health support for young people in this age group, with robust data collection. General palliative or end-of-life care, or services for adults/children outside 11-25, are not eligible. Current funding rounds are closed.",Low Match,"1. Applicant type matches: Ellenor Hospice is a UK registered charity. 2. Geographic scope matches: Funding is UK-wide, including Kent. 3. Beneficiary focus is a poor match: The Prudence Trust funds are strictly for young people aged 11-25, with a focus on mental health (prevention, treatment, social prescribing, research). Ellenor Hospice serves a broader age range and primarily provides palliative/end-of-life care, not direct mental health interventions for the 11-25 age group. 4. Restrictions: Must deliver direct mental health support to young people 11-25 and collect relevant data; general hospice/palliative care is not eligible. 5. Application status: All current rounds are closed, with no open opportunities. 6. Funding range is suitable, but only for eligible projects. Overall, Ellenor Hospice is a low match unless it has a dedicated, evidence-based mental health programme for young people aged 11-25. Even then, applications are not currently being accepted. Recommendation: Monitor for future rounds if Ellenor develops a qualifying youth mental health programme.",15,15,2025-10-15 13:10:57,
