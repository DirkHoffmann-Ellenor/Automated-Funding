About us We are a grantmaking trust that currently funds work to support the autonomy, liberty and civil rights of autistic, neurodivergent and disabled people. We fund projects in the UK. Our values Who we are We are a small team: we have three trustees, who have three advisers and three grantmaking staff, all part-time. For some of our grant making we have a panel of Disabled or neurodivergent people and people who have experience of advice and advocacy who recommend projects for support. Information about our grant making is published in our annual reports and accounts, available on the Charity Commission website, and in real time on 360 Giving. Information about our governance is also available from the Charity Commission.
