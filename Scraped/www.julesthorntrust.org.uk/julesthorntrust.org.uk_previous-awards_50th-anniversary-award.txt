Disruption of sleep and circadian rhythms is a feature shared by some of the most challenging diseases of our time, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, cataracts and glaucoma. It is also widespread in the ageing population, those who work shifts, and everyone affected by the demands of today’s 24/7 society. The new Sir Jules Thorn Institute will have a transformative effect on the development of evidence-based treatments to enhance the health and quality of life for millions of individuals across the world. University College London in partnership with Moorfields Eye Hospital This initiative is integral to plans to establish world-class translational research facilities which will form part of a wider redevelopment of Moorfields Eye Hospital and the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, creating for the first time a truly integrated treatment, research and education centre of excellence. The Trust’s funding will facilitate the creation of The Sir Jules Thorn Clinical Investigation Centre, which will be at the heart of the new infrastructure, providing modern and flexible facilities to translate research breakthroughs faster, and on a larger scale, to benefit more people in the UK and around the world. The aim is to make The Sir Jules Thorn Clinical Investigation Centre the world’s leading clinical research establishment for eye and vision diseases.
