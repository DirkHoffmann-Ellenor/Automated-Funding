Good Fundraising Practice: The Foundation is a member of the Fundraising Regulator and abides by it’s Code of Practice for Fundraising. All our fundraising is legal, open, honest and respectful at all times. We will NEVER fundraise in a way that may be considered an unreasonable intrusion onto a person’s privacy, is overly persistent, or places undue pressure to donate. We ALWAYS consider the needs of any donors who may be in vulnerable circumstances or need extra care and support to make an informed decision and will not accept a donation if we believe that person to lack the ability to make an informed decision or believe them to be in vulnerable circumstances. We have absolute confidence in the professionalism and responsibility of our colleagues and are on hand if at any point you have further questions or require additional support. We are committed to operating the lottery in a socially responsible way.
