We use our Dialogues programme to convene people and foster collaboration around specific issues within our areas of interest. We host these opportunities in the beautiful spaces that we have at Waddesdon, using the environment around us to inspire collective ambition and action. Dialogues has been used to explore sustainable investment with the Smith School, University of Oxford and Chatham House, gender equality with the Young Foundation and Women of the World and homelessness prevention with Community Impact Bucks. Increasingly we use Dialogues to inform our grant-making priorities. We piloted this approach in 2019 with our Creative Explorers programme.
