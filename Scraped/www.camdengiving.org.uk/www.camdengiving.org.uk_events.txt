Women's Only Funding Advice Thursday, March 6, 2025 12:30 PM 2:30 PM Camden Giving (map) Google Calendar ICS On the eve of International Women’s Day, Camden Giving are running a women’s-only-funding advice session with Camden Council, the Young Camden Foundation, the KOKO Foundation and BBC Children In Need. This is an informal session, booking isn’t required, if you have access requirements please email natasha@camdengiving.org.uk in advance. Join us with questions about applying for funding to any of these organisations or general grantmaking applications. We’re running this session because we know women face barriers to receiving funding and because we receive less applications from women-led organisations to our larger funds.
