Get Support Eligibility We support Freemasons and people with a strong family connection to a Freemason. The Freemason must be, or have been, a member of a lodge regulated by the United Grand Lodge of England . The Freemason does not need to be a currently subscribing member, but he must have joined before the need arose. Please be aware that if the Freemason’s membership is not active, there is a set period of time after the membership ended in which an application can be submitted. Please contact us for further information. We define those with a strong family connection as a Freemason’s: married or life partner widow or surviving partner divorced or separated partner child or stepchild (under 25) in full-time education grandchild or step grandchild (under 25) in full-time education Other relations may also qualify for support if they can demonstrate that a Freemason has provided them with significant financial or physical support.
