I want to leave a Legacy or set up a Legacy Fund Leaving a gift in your will is a way of making a lasting contribution and impact for your community for generations to come. In the same way as setting up a fund, you direct where the money goes – specifying where and what you want to support. That may be one local need or geographical area or a whole range We can help you using our knowledge and expertise of local need. You can rest assured that the Community Foundation will work to honour the aims of your gift for generations to come and you can put your name to the gift if you wish. There are a number of options based on your circumstances and wishes. You can name Leicestershire and Rutland Community Foundation as the beneficiary of your gift without any restrictions, giving us the maximum flexibility to continue our work building a strong foundation for local communities. You can leave a gift of any size to support a particular cause or community through our Making Local Life Better Fund: we will give grants to your chosen area either immediately or via investing for an annual charitable income, directed by you. If you want to leave a gift of £20,000 or more in your Will, you can set up a named fund within our endowment which will give in perpetuity, for generations to come. Making or updating your Will to include a legacy for us to manage doesn’t have to be expensive or complicated. However, we do advise you see a solicitor to update or draft your Will; just let them know that you would like to have a legacy fund with the Community Foundation. We can help you – or them – through decisions and choices at no charge. To find out more or to get in touch, click the button below or email us: admin@llrcommunityfoundation.org.uk .
