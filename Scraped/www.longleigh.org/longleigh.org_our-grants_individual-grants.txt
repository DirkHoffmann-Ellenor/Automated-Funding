Finding Breathing Space: Sarah’s Story Sarah and her partner * faced financial difficulty when she left her job and her partner was diagnosed with cancer. Despite receiving Universal Credit, bills and travel costs for hospital appointments left them with nothing to cover essentials. Longleigh awarded them £1,000, which covered utilities, food, and petrol for hospital visits. Sarah said: “The money gave us the breathing space to focus on my partner and his health. The whole experience was stress-free, and the support arrived just when we needed it most.” The grant helped them avoid rent arrears, budget effectively, and feel more secure. Sarah encourages others in similar situations to reach out: “Take a deep breath, listen, follow their advice and you won’t go wrong. Longleigh has given us confidence that there is light at the end of the tunnel.” *Names changed to protect identities. Our Data and 360Giving We are committed to transparency.
