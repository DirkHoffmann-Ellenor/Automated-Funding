ENVIRONMENT Monday 7th February Supporting Pesticide Action Network UK We are increasingly directing funds and developing our learning on the health implications of harmful chemicals. One strand of our focus involves addressing the impact of pesticides on planetary and human health. Pesticides appear in millions of different combinations in varying concentrations in our food, water and soil, creating toxic mixtures known and the ‘cocktail effect’ . Since 2020, we have partnered with Pesticide Action Network UK , the only UK charity focused on tackling the issues caused by pesticides. PAN UK produces a wealth of accessible information & research on the problems caused by pesticides, in addition to working on efforts to strengthen regulatory systems for our protection, and creating awareness on our everyday exposure to chemical cocktails. To find out more about the work of PAN UK, head over to their website including their FAQ on all things pesticide-related.
