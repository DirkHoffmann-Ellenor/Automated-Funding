We make grants which are designed to make a difference to the lives of disabled children and their families and to improve access to good palliative care. Exciting News Â Â Winners of African Palliative Care Association Photography Competition Announced! Â What we do We are working towards a time when everyone, wherever they live and whatever their age, is able to access good palliative care, and disabled children and young people are able to live their lives to the full. We do this in various ways. We listen to those with lived experience to identify need and develop solutions. We have an open application process for our small grants programmes for local initiatives while our major programmes and projects funding is developed in partnership with organisations who share our vision, rather than via an open application process. We work in the UK and Africa.
