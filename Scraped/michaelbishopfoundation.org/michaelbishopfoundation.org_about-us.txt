About Us The Michael Bishop Foundation was established in 1987 by its founder Michael Bishop, (now Lord Glendonbrook). As majority owner of the bmi British Midland airline group since leading a management buy out in the 1970’s, he built the group into a major force at London Heathrow, as well as creating several regional businesses and a low cost operation. He was knighted in 1991 and was made a life peer in 2011 as Baron Glendonbrook of Bowdon. Since selling his majority shareholding in the airline to Lufthansa in 2009 he has regularly gifted significant funds to the Foundation and it currently has investments totalling approximately £45m. Since 1987 the Foundation has donated over £35m to more than 100 charities in the United Kingdom and in Australia through the Glendonbrook Foundation. We now regularly donate between £2 to £3m each year to a wide variety of charitable causes selected by the Trustees principally in the five focus areas. Some examples of organisations and projects we have recently funded include: We have provided multi-year funding to assist promising students to benefit from education at Somerville College, Oxford regardless of their personal circumstances. In 2022 we agreed to provide £1m over a four year period for the conservation of four of the country’s most historic sites at Dover Castle, Hardwick Old Hall, Brodsworth Hall and North Leigh Roman Villa. In 2022 we made a £500,000 commitment over a 3 year period to assist the company with two main priorities; firstly to provide support towards the creation of three new full length ballets and new programmes of one act ballets and secondly to invest in the adaptation of the existing classical work in order to reduce the cost of touring these productions around the United Kingdom.
