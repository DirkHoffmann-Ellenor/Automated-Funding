We aim to have effective governance, a strong business culture, clear values, and positive engagement with the life sciences ecosystem through our engagement with industry and our support for charity. We are actively engaged with our portfolio companies as they seek to build sustainable businesses. “We have a strong commitment to sustainability, integrating it throughout our investment process and portfolio management. At the heart of it all is the SIML’s team motivation to make a difference.” Key pillars of our Sustainability Policy We have engaged with our key stakeholders to understand the sustainability issues which are most material to the business. The outcome of the materiality assessment has been used to develop our Sustainability Policy which focuses on four key pillars. Our social impact Responsible investor and partner Inspiring and empowering our people Responsible and ethical business Sustainability Report 2025 Our 2025 Sustainability Report outlines our Sustainability Policy, our approach to responsible investing and how we manage sustainability within the portfolio, and covers our activities for the 2024/5 financial year. Our approach to reporting Making and demonstrating a positive contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is a key part of our approach to reporting on sustainability. The four key UN SDGs which our business is well-aligned with are: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Syncona is a signatory to the UN PRI Syncona first became a signatory to the UN PRI in October 2021, underlining its commitment to reporting on its responsible investment approach. The PRI is recognised as the world's leading network for investors who are committed to integrating sustainability factors into their investment and stewardship practices. The Principles are aligned with the work being undertaken by Syncona as we engage with our portfolio companies on issues around sustainability in-line with our Responsible Investment Policy. Syncona submitted its first questionnaire to the PRI in FY2023/4 and remains committed to reporting to the PRI on an annual basis. Reporting in-line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures The TCFD recommendations ask companies to assess how they may be exposed to the physical risks of climate change, as well as the transition risks which could impact companies as there is a forced transition towards a green economy. Although Syncona remains out of scope for mandatory TCFD reporting, it began reporting against the TCFD guidelines in FY2021/2 to underline its commitment to a comprehensive sustainability reporting framework. Publishing out first net zero target The Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative is a growing collective of leading asset managers, including over 300 signatories holding nearly $59 trillion of AUM. The aim of the initiative is to bring together asset managers committed to supporting the goal of reaching net zero GHG emissions by 2050 or sooner, in line with the Paris Goals. We underlined our commitment to limiting our portfolio’s environmental footprint by signing up to the NZAM initiative in 2023, and publishing our first NZAM target in 2024. This supports our overall aspiration to be net zero across our full value chain by 2050.
