Funding is competitive. Some funds require partnership with NHS/universities for research. Ann Rylands Small Donations is for smaller charities; ellenor's income may exceed this threshold. Capital and research funds require strong research or innovation focus.",Highly Eligible,"1. The Trust explicitly funds UK-registered charities, including hospices and palliative care organisations, as shown by multiple hospice grantees (e.g., Treetops Hospice Trust, Keech Hospice Care, St Luke’s Hospice Plymouth). 2. Geographic scope is UK-wide, including Kent. 3. Beneficiary focus matches ellenor Hospice’s work: people with life-limiting conditions, palliative care, families, and carers. 4. Funding amounts are suitable for a range of projects, from small donations to large capital/research grants. 5. No restrictions exclude hospices or healthcare charities; explicit exclusions are for overseas, religious, or recently funded organisations. 6. Application status varies by programme, but at least one (Ann Rylands Small Donations) appears rolling/regular, and others have future deadlines. 7. Evidence from previous awards and testimonials confirms hospices are welcomed and have been funded for both care and innovation projects. 8. The only minor concern is that Ann Rylands Small Donations may be aimed at smaller charities, but ellenor is eligible for larger capital or innovation funds. Overall, ellenor Hospice is highly eligible and should consider applying to the most appropriate programme based on project type and size.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:42:53,
