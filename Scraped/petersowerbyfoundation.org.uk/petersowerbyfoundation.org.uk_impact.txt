Impact At the Peter Sowerby Foundation, we always seek to support projects that can provide the maximum impact from the funds provided. To see the evidence of this, our Trustees ask grant recipients to report on the outputs, outcomes and impact of their grant, and in turn they measure the impact of the Foundation as a whole. Since it was established in 2013, the Foundation has awarded 89 grants to 63 organisations. Some of these have been small grants to local, grass-roots organisations while others have been to large, well-established charities and educational institutions. In total, we have awarded over Â£10 million in grants since we started. We've identified some overlapping themes across our main metrics where we've made significant impact: a focus on young people, projects related to Yorkshire end of life care arts and creativity
