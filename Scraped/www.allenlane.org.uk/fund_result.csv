Most programmes are adult-focused; only the Young People’s Programme covers ages 12-21.",Not Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity providing palliative and end-of-life care in Kent, which is within the Foundation's geographic scope. However, the Allen Lane Foundation explicitly states: 'To make sure our grants have an impact, we fund relatively small organisations. If you work across a local area such as a village, estate or town, to be eligible you will need to have income/expenditure of less than £100,000. At the other end of the spectrum, if you work across the whole of the UK you will need to have an income of less than £250,000.' ellenor Hospice's annual income is £8.2M, which is far above the eligibility threshold. Additionally, the Foundation only funds work that directly benefits one of seven specific groups (asylum seekers & refugees, Gypsy/Roma/Traveller communities, offenders/ex-offenders, older people, people affected by violence/abuse, people with mental health issues, and young people 12-21 with specific vulnerabilities). While ellenor Hospice serves older people and those with life-limiting conditions, its general palliative care focus does not directly align with the Foundation's targeted beneficiary groups. Therefore, ellenor Hospice is not eligible for Allen Lane Foundation funding.",10,10,2025-10-15 13:02:56,
