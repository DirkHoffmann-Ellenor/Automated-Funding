As we start to implement our Change We Seek strategy, members of our team are working to identify potential grant partners through our networks, internal research, and our systems-driven approach to learning. This means we are unable to consider unsolicited funding proposals. You can learn more about our approach to grant-making here . If you are a current grant partner and have any questions about your grant, please reach out to your dedicated team member via the email address they’ve provided. If you are an organisation looking for funding please do not spend time preparing a funding proposal and sending this to us, as we are unable to take forward applications that reach us this way.
