Thank you in advance for taking the time to keep us updated on your progress. Your reports not only help us learn what works and why in the services you provide but also allow us to review our own effectiveness as a funder, so we can focus on what delivers the most impact. As a grant holder, we ask you to submit reports every six months throughout the life of your grant. This regular check-in helps us stay informed about your progress. Except for the Final Report, our Progress and End of Year Reports are designed to be light touch – usually just a single tick-box exercise if everything is on track. We hope you’ll encounter no difficulties, but if your circumstances change or you face any challenges – either in delivering your work or at an organisational level – please be open and let us know as soon as possible. We only request information that is necessary for our grantmaking evaluation and due diligence, and we aim to keep reporting requirements as brief as possible. If you have already prepared reports for other funders about the work we are supporting, you are welcome to submit those in place of our Final Report. Guidance on reporting All reports are submitted online, and we’ll send you reminders when they’re due. Below, you’ll find helpful guidance on the information required for your project monitoring and evaluation. If you prefer to work offline, you’re welcome to use the drafting form to prepare your final report before submitting it online. Progress report (guidance document) – six months after the start of the grant End of Year report (guidance document) – at the end of each year of a multi-year grant Final report (guidance for grant holders & drafting document) – at the end of your grant (you can submit reports you have already prepared for other funders instead) Consult our Grant holders FAQs for further information on reporting. If you have any questions, please email us or call us on 0117 9596496 – we’ll be happy to advise.
