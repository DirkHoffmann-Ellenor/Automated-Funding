Project 2018 Living Root Bridges ar.tum.de The living root bridges of Meghalaya are striking examples of living architecture, woven over streams and ravines from the aerial roots of the Indian Rubber Tree in a rare example of symbiotic natural and human engineering. The research project ‘Living Root Bridges’ aims to obtain rich insights on the strength mechanisms of trees, on engineering for the purpose of loading and on the valuable study of biomimetics. Learning more about these natural structures can both benefit our approach in constructing the built environment and raise the profile of living sustainable design. Impact gaining new and valuable insights for future application in the built environment gathering knowledge on earthquake and flood resistance, humidity resistance, optimisation through growth, and self-repair promoting the role of nature and biometric learnings for the benefit of the future built environment promoting sustainable, zero-emission construction practices Catalyst for Change exhibition Featured film Wilfrid Middleton’s Living Root Bridges Research investigates sustainable living architecture and the fascinating insights it provides for human-made infrastructure. Wilfrid Middleton is undertaking a PhD in Green Technologies in Landscape Architecture, Technical University of Munich, and carrying out site research in Meghalaya, India.
