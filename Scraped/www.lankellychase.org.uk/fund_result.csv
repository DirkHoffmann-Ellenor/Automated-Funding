Traditional service delivery or charity models may not align with their priorities. Emphasis on mutual learning and systemic change.",Possibly Eligible,"Lankelly Chase funds UK-based organisations, networks, and individuals working to 'reveal, question and dismantle or heal, reimagine and transform systems,' with a focus on those addressing mental distress, violence, and destitution among marginalised groups. While ellenor Hospice is a UK charity working with vulnerable people, its core activities are palliative and end-of-life care, which may not align with the foundation's emphasis on systemic change over direct service delivery. There is no explicit exclusion of hospices, but the foundation's language ('justice, not charity') and examples suggest a preference for projects that address root causes and systemic transformation rather than ongoing care provision. Application process and funding range are not clearly stated, and there is no open call for traditional grants. Therefore, ellenor Hospice may be eligible if proposing a project focused on systemic change in palliative care or addressing structural barriers for their beneficiaries, but general hospice activities are unlikely to be a strong fit.",6,6,2025-10-15 12:43:35,
