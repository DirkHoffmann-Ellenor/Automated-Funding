After receiving a grant If you have received a grant from the Foundation, you will be required to provide us with annual progress updates and a final report on the outcome of the project on which Foundation funds were used. Inquiry If there are any grounds for the Foundation to question whether its grants have been used appropriately, the Foundation Board can request an inquiry into the project’s finances to be conducted by an external third party at the applicant’s expense.
