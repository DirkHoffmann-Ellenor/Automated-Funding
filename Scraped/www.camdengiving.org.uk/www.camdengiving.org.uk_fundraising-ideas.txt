Whether you want to take on a personal challenge, host a local event, or support one of our targeted initiatives, we’re here to help. Not sure where to start? Contact our Partnerships and Communications Manager at yodit@camdengiving.org.uk for advice and guidance. Join a run, walk, or obstacle course to push your limits while raising funds.
