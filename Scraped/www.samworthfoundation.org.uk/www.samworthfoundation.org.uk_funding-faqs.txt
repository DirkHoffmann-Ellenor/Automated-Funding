We don’t operate an open fund so please don’t spend valuable time writing to us for funding because we are unable to respond to requests. We fund organisations from any part of the UK or who work internationally. Where we can, we will offer unrestricted grants, as we believe that unrestricted funding enables organisations to be more flexible and responsive to the needs they identify, and gives grantholders control over how the money they receive is spent. Where this is not possible, we may offer core funding or project specific grants. There is no minimum or maximum amount you can apply for. Last year our grants ranged from £86,000 to £300,000 and the average grant size was £73,000. To get an idea of the kind of grants we award, take a look at the grant list or on 360Giving . Most of our grants are for two or three years, but as a responsive and flexible funder, we will consider different time frames. If you have been invited to apply, a Grants Manager will discuss this with you.
