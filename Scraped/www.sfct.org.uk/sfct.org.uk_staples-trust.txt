About the Trust Grantmaking process Frankopan Fund About the Trust Staples Trust was founded by Jessica Sainsbury in 1992. From the beginning, Jessica has been proactive in helping organisations at a critically early stage in development and supported projects in areas such as environment, gender, indigenous peoples and inequality. The Trust is named after Mary Ann Staples, wife of John James Sainsbury. They both founded the first Sainsbury’s store on London’s Drury Lane in 1869. What we fund Staples supports projects in the following areas: Environment, Gender, Indigenous Peoples, and Inequality. The Trust also supports a small number of projects which fall outside these areas. Under the Frankopan Fund , it supports a grants programme for Croatian students who are pursuing postgraduate courses in the UK and internationally. Occasionally, the Trust also responds to international emergency appeals. We don’t fund Applications for funding are generally invited by the Trustees or initiated at their request. Unsolicited applications are unlikely to be successful. The Trustees prefer to support projects which can be successfully replicated or become self-sustaining. Aside from awards made under the Frankopan Fund, grants are not normally made to individuals.
