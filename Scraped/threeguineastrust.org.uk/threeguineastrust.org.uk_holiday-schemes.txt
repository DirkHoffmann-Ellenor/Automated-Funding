Holiday activity schemes for autistic children and young people 2025 round The grants round is now closed. 2026 round The 2026 round will focus more strongly on autistic-specific holiday schemes. It will run in the spring of 2026. About the programme This scheme provides grants of up to £15,000 to activity schemes for autistic children and young people, and their siblings, which run in the school holidays. Grants are usually for part of the costs. This programme is for: Autistic-specific activity programmes that run in the school holidays in the UK (including sessions for siblings). Or: The extra costs for autistic children and young people who require personalised support to take part in other play and activity schemes. To apply you will need to meet these conditions: Be a not-for-profit organisation. Have a safeguarding policy ( what we expect on safeguarding ). Use professionally trained staff and volunteers (not parents/guardians) For autistic children and young people who need one-to-one or greater support: staff and volunteers must have specific training on how to provide this (we will ask for details). Have a bank account with two people to authorise or check on payments. Priorities for funding will be given to autistic-specific schemes. What we won’t fund Residential activities. Projects that use Applied Behavioural Analysis or other contested forms of coercive behavioural control. Schools, nurseries, early years settings, local authorities or NHS Trusts. When can I apply for the 2026 round? Please check back in mid-January 2026 when details of the programme will be updated. In 2025, we opened this programme to expressions of interest from across the UK. This created an overwhelming response. The funds available for the programme are limited. We will refine the criteria for the 2006 grants round to focus more strongly on organisations that provide holiday programmes specifically for autistic children and their siblings.
