Apply for funding & support In this section Our vision is to see an end to youth homelessness in the UK. As part of our work towards this vision, by 2029 we aim to positively support 10,000 young people who are homeless, have experienced homelessness or are at risk of homelessness in the future. We help charities supporting young people facing homelessness to find free, high-quality, professional skills, services, and advice; generously provided by our corporate pro bono partners. We aim to provide £1 million of Pro Bono support per year, and help to deliver £4.5 million of Vodafone data to the homelessness sector annually, saving charities vital funding and resources, empowering them to maximise their impact . To achieve these aims we have a range of grants, and a suite of free professional services available to eligible youth homelessness focussed charities and non-profit organisations. Through our grants we help provide homes, jobs and skills to thousands of young people 16-25 who are at risk of or experiencing homelessness. At LandAid, we don’t just give out capital grants. We also help charities to find free, high quality professional skills, services, and advice, generously provided by our corporate pro bono partners. LandAid and Vodafone are tackling digital exclusion through providing connectivity to people experiencing homelessness. Apply now for free SIM cards!
