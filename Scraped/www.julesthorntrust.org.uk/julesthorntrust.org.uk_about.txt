Our funds are generated from an endowment from Sir Jules Thorn. The Trust is a grant making charity endowed by Sir Jules Thorn. The resources provided by its endowment have enabled the Trust to give substantial support to a wide range of charitable causes in the United Kingdom. In keeping with the founder’s wishes the Trust’s most significant grants finance important medical research. Many related aspects of medicine are also supported including the upgrading of medical facilities and equipment, the care of the sick and the management of serious illness. In the broader humanitarian field, the grants are intended to make life easier for those who live with disabilities, who suffer disadvantage or who are in need of support in dealing with difficulties in their lives. We have awarded over £120million in grants since our establishment in 1964 supporting numerous projects across the UK. The Trust is governed by a Board of Trustees and has a small staff team in its London office.
