All supported staff must be paid at least the London Living Wage.,Not Eligible,"1. Key matching factors: ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity providing health-related services, which aligns with the funder's focus on health improvement. 2. Concerns or limitations: The most significant limitation is geographic—London Catalyst funds projects and organisations that benefit people living in London (covering all London boroughs). ellenor Hospice is based in Gravesend, Kent, and serves Dartford, Gravesham, Swanley, and Bexley. Of these, only Bexley is a London borough, but the majority of ellenor's service area is outside London. 3. Specific quotes: 'To enable organisations to improve the health of Londoners by tackling poverty and social isolation.' 'Covering all London boroughs.' 'We would expect to see [London Living Wage] rate of pay reflected in all charity budgets seeking support.' 4. Overall recommendation: Because ellenor Hospice's primary service area is outside London and only a small part of its catchment (Bexley) is within a London borough, it does not meet the core geographic eligibility. Therefore, ellenor Hospice is Not Eligible for this funding opportunity.",1,1,2025-12-09 11:44:10,
