Blue Light Card Foundation 'Workplace Wellbeing Fund' Thank you to everyone who nominated their team for our first community grant scheme. We have been overwhelmed by the number of applications and the thought, passion and care that went into them. Reading through the applications has shown just how much having a space to connect and decompress at work really matters. Our team faced the challenging task of selecting twenty projects to go forward to the public vote. To ensure a fair and equal opportunity, our team carefully considered service type, region, and country when reviewing applications. This approach helped create a shortlist that represents a mix of wellbeing spaces and activities, supports a wide range of services, and reaches different geographic areas across the UK. CEO Emma Woods-Bolger said: “It’s been inspiring to see applications from across the UK and from such a broad range of Blue Light community services. The ideas put forward demonstrate just how valuable this fund is for workplace wellbeing.” Thank you to everyone who has voted! Voting is now closed, and we’ll be announcing the successful projects shortly. £2,000 grants to support the wellbeing of the blue light community at work.
