Applications will open online on 1st August and close on 29th August at 5pm. Payments will be made in early October. We read every single application made. We are looking to fund initiatives that help create meaningful social connections for people aged 65 and over, including: – Befriending services, including meal delivery for those living independently – Social groups, such as art classes, dance sessions, lunch clubs, and coffee mornings – Community transport, connecting older people to local activities and services Please note: Dementia-specific charities and groups will not be eligible in this grant round, as we have a dedicated Dementia Grants Programme launching in Spring 2026. In May 2025, this programme awarded £130,000 to dementia-related causes. However, charities that serve a broad older population — including individuals with dementia — are still welcome to apply for a Creating Connections grant. To apply for funding you must be a registered charity, community group with constitution or Community Interest Company working in England, Scotland or Wales with a turnover under £250,000 p.a. CICs must be limited by guarantee and apply for project funding only. We will be prioritising funding into areas where there is the highest deprivation for older people. This helps to ensure that our funding goes to the areas that need it the most. You can read more here in our grant guidance document
