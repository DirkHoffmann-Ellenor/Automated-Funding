Grant Summaries Projects Funded in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland Grant Summaries Every year, Leicestershire and Rutland Community Foundation delivers vital and essential grants that support other local charitable organisations to deliver vital services in the heart of our communities. These organisations range from household names to small local organisations you may never heard of, yet all of them are delivering their services to make local life better for all of us who live and work in Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland. We continue to administer grants on behalf of our donors. The donors direct their giving, and we manage the administration. We also give grants for agencies, the NHS, government, the National Emergencies Trust, and we reinvigorate dormant trusts. Each year, we produce a summary of all the grants that have been given. Please feel free to have a look through at all of the projects that we have funded in this and previous years.
