Mission We contribute to our vision by following our mission to fund and support organisations and individuals that have ambitious ideas to help disadvantaged young people – and – by ensuring we only work with organisations and individuals who are trusted by young people. Joseph Levy led by example and stood by the familiar saying – we make a living by what we get but we make a life by what we give . Inspired by our founder and his son Lawrence, our trustees are guided by a set of values: Equity and Inclusivity: Some people experience greater disadvantage than others – we will prioritise young people who are most in need. Connectivity and Collaboration: We will work alongside others and use our convening power to connect people, projects, and ideas. Commitment and Integrity: We are reliable, dedicated, open, honest, and clear in intention. Innovation and Imagination: Complex problems require creative solutions – we will work with ambition and seek new ways of doing things. Engagement and Joy for Life: We are engaged with communities who support young people – we will develop trusted relationships.
