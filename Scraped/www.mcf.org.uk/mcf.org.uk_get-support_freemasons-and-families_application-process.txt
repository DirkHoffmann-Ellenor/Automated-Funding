Get Support Application process We support Freemasons and people with a strong family connection to a Freemason. Speak to your lodge Almoner, or contact our Enquiries team: 0800 035 60 90 help@mcf.org.uk The Enquiries team will listen to your situation and advise you on all the ways we can support you. If we cannot offer support, you will be directed to other organisations that may be able to help. If you are eligible for support, a Visiting Volunteer or a member of our Advice & Support Team will visit you at home to help you complete an application form. A member of our Grants team will process your application and inform you of the outcome. This usually takes 6-8 weeks, but may take longer. Are you from an overseas District or Group?
