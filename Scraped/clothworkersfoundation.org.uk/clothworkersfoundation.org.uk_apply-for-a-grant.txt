Applying for funding under the Open Grants Programme In this section you can learn more about our Open Grants Programme â particularly what we fund, and how we make our decisions. We also explain our process and tell you how you can apply. Open Grants Our Open Grants Programme funds capital costs that support the infrastructure needs of small- and medium-sized charitable organisations working with disadvantaged and marginalised people and communities. We prioritise funding to organisations that are led by, or fully integrate in their decision-making, people with related lived experience, and to projects that allow organisations to make a big change to their reach, impact, or sustainability. We fund both large and small projects. The size of grant awarded will depend on a number of factors, including the size of your organisation and the cost and scale of your capital project. We do not fund projects of Â£15,000 or under for organisations with a turnover of more than Â£2 million. This means organisations with a turnover of more than Â£2 million cannot apply for a small grant. In 2024, our application success rate was 47%.

Digital Infrastructure This includes, but is not limited to, one-off (not ongoing) costs for the digitisation of processes, the development or updating of communication platforms such as websites or apps, or adding digital features to existing services. These projects should be well past the âbrainstormingâ phase, and be ready for development. Vehicles This includes, but is not limited to, minibuses, cars, caravans, people carriers, 4x4s and boats. We are unlikely to fund the total cost of a new vehicle or award funding to an organisation that already owns a large number of vehicles.

Our Impact Framework informs our decision making in this area. We prioritise: Organisations embedding lived experience Organisations that embed lived experience of the issues they tackle in their decision-making at all levels. We understand this looks different for different organisations, and we ask questions about this in our application forms. Projects that will lead to significant change Projects that will make a significant change to the delivery, reach or sustainability of an organisation. This may include projects that allow an organisation to own its own building, undertake a refurbishment that can increase the numbers it serves and/or the quality of the work it does, own a vehicle for the first time, or significantly increase reach or delivery through new digital infrastructure. We may fund applications from organisations that score highly on one criteria, but are very unlikely to fund those that do not score highly on either. We prioritise applications that score highly within one or both of our Impact Framework criteria. However, there are other reasons we may decline an application. â Below is a list of the most common reasons that lead us to turn down an application: The organisationâs structure or organisation type was ineligible. There is not a strong enough fit across our Programme Areas. The financial need was not sufficiently evidenced. We are not confident of the organisationâs financial position. For example, there may be insufficient revenue funding in place to remain a going concern. The request was for a non-capital project. The organisationâs secular activities were not sufficiently demonstrated. The organisationâs fundraising plan does not seem adequate to meet the needs of the project. The request was for retrospective funding (i.e., a project that had already been completed). Due to the size of the project costs, we are unable to award a meaningful grant. The organisation lacks a sufficient track record. Application process We ask everyone who is interested in our funding to complete our Eligibility Quiz . This will help you understand whether or not you are eligible to apply for funding. Eligible organisations are invited to submit applications for a SmallÂ Grant (up to Â£15,000) with a one-stage application process, or a Large Grant (more than Â£15,000), which has a two-stage application process. The Large Grant application process aims to to minimise time completing forms and waiting on a decision for applicants unlikely to be successful. Eligibility If you are eligible to apply, you will be directed to a page on our website, and a link to our grants application portal. You will need to create a new account for the grants portal, where you can begin your application. Stage 1 Small Grants have a one-stage application process, with one form. These are reviewed on a rolling basis. We aim to respond within 12 weeks. Large Grants have a two-stage application process; the first form will capture information on your organisation, your project, and its intended impact. These are reviewed on a rolling basis. We aim to respond within six weeks. Stage 2 Organisations with Large Grant applications that score highest against our Impact Framework are invited to submit a full application (expected within four months). The second-stage application form will ask for additional information on your organisation and project. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis. We aim to respond within six months.
