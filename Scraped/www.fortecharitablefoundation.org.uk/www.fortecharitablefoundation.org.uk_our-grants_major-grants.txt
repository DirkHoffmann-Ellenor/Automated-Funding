Our Grants Major Grants Organisations should have a focus on Family Support, this may further include: Early intervention Families coping with addiction Prisoners' families We fund voluntary sector organisations with a turnover up to £500,000. Your organisation’s postcode, or the project area, must be ranked within the most deprived 15% of the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) for urban areas or within the most deprived 50% for rural areas. Adventure Playgrounds, Baby Banks and Disability charities cannot apply to our Major Grants programme. Our preference is for front line organisations working directly with families in need. We are unlikely to support campaigning, fundraising, organisational development or capacity building. We will consider projects which are a logical extension of existing work. We do not support work which represents a significant shift away from the existing core aims and track record of an organisation. Trustees will consider the additionality of grant funds to the financial situation of a charity. Please see ‘ Who and What We Fund ’ for examples and also a full list of exclusions. Ready to apply?
