Making grants to support vulnerable and disadvantaged people in Kent and Medway to improve their life chances and emotional wellbeing or help to break down barriers preventing them from participating in employment, education or training. Making grants to support the rehabilitation of offenders and help reduce the collateral consequences of their imprisonment on their families; with the aim of reducing reoffending, making the communities of Kent and Medway safer. Working in partnership with carefully selected organisations to deliver small grants to the most vulnerable young people in Kent and Medway, improving their opportunities to access employment or training. In addition to their main grant programmes, periodically the trustees will invite large funding proposals on themes they identify as being of key importance. These special programmes will be announced on this website. In addition to making grants in response to funding applications, occasionally the Trust ‘proactively’ invites proposals to further its long-term strategic plans and vision for Kent. We do not accept direct applications for this programme. Contact us Privacy Statement Press © 2018 Colyer-Fergusson Charitable Trust | all rights reserved | Registered Charity 258958
