UN Sustainable Development Goals Set in 2015 by the United Nations Member States, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a collection of interlinked goals – used around the world – which are a ‘blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all’. SDGs are an urgent call for action by all countries to ending poverty and deprivation working hand in hand with strategies to improve health and education, reduce inequality and create economic growth, all whilst tackling the climate crisis to preserve our world. SDGs are intended to be achieved by 2030 as part of The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . SDG focus at Two Ridings Two Ridings use SDGs to measure how we meet the needs of the communities in North and East Yorkshire that we support. Because SDGs are recognised globally we feel this is the best and simplest way for people to understand the impact our support makes to local people and places. There are 17 goals in total, but at Two Ridings we focus on nine that demonstrate best how we work with communities. Delving deeper into SDGs Transforming Communities through grant making Our programmes and grants team have been using SDGs to measure how our funding benefits people and communities for some time, but we are now moving all our impact reporting to also include them. People at the heart of everything we do Our top five SDGs embody everything we are trying to achieve for local people: Ending poverty in all its forms Ending hunger and achieving food security for everyone Ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages Reducing inequality across the region Making our communities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable Championing positive change We work with the UK Community Foundation’s SDG group to create a consistent message across Community Foundations all over the country. We have started a new rolling Climate Change Small Grants Fund to give groups across the region the opportunity to be climate-prepared.
