Each statement contains details of your fund balance, grants you have made, fluctuations in investment income or fund value and your agreed contribution to Quartet’s running costs. New fund statements are available each month. Please contact your Fund Manager if you have any questions or would like any more detailed information at any other time. You can add to your fund at any time: Online by choosing your fund in the donate now page By cheque, made out to ‘ Quartet Community Foundation ’. Please include a note to tell us that the donation is intended for your fund. By bank transfer; please find the details in your welcome pack or get in touch with us directly. If you have a permanent endowment fund you can choose whether new donations are added to your permanent endowment or go straight to your grant-making pot. The different options incur different charges. Before adding to your fund, first tell your Fund Manager which option you’d prefer. Secure login Sign in to view your fund statements I want to...
