Round 1 of the Small Grants Fund (SGF) will support small scale, place-based projects involving early career researchers in two-way (or multi-way) research and knowledge exchange. SGF applications are encouraged that incorporate partnership and cross-sectoral working. Funded projects will focus on scaling and embedding research, knowledge and learning about UK coastal and marine resilience across and between different UK groups, including academic researchers, practitioners, policymakers and coastal communities. SGF will support the development of place-sensitive models for community-led action. The co-leads of funded projects will be invited to share outputs and outcomes with the Coast-R Network, as well as benefitting from further support from the Resilient Coastal Communities and Seas Programme. More information about the schemeâ€™s scope, priority areas, eligibility, and expected outcomes and outputs, are available on the Coast-R Network website . We are also pleased to invite interested parties to a free webinar at 11am-12noon on Tuesday 7 October, where Professor Briony McDonagh and Coast-R Network Project Manager, Emma Platt-Lowe will give an introduction to the SGF and take part in a Q&A.
