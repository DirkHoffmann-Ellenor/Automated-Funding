Focus is on charities solely supporting children/young people or parents affected by ACEs.,Possibly Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a UK registered charity with an annual income of £8.2M (under the £20M cap) and over 5 years of operation. The James Tudor Foundation Mental Health Grants Programme is open to regional and national charities across the UK, with a focus on children, young people, and parents affected by Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). ellenor provides palliative and end-of-life care, including bereavement support and therapies for children and families, which may overlap with trauma-informed support. However, the fund requires that the applicant's key focus is on preventing/reducing the impact of ACEs and that they are 'solely' focused on supporting these groups through evidence-based, trauma-informed interventions. While ellenor supports children and families, its primary mission is palliative care, not exclusively ACEs or trauma. Therefore, eligibility is possible if ellenor can demonstrate a dedicated, trauma-informed programme for children/parents affected by ACEs, but it is not a direct or highly targeted match. Application is open until 5 November 2025, and no restrictions explicitly exclude hospices. Next step: Review whether ellenor's services can be framed as trauma-informed ACEs interventions and use the eligibility checker.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:30:58,
