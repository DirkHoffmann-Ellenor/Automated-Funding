Our fundraising promise Your gift, whatever the size, is precious, and we promise to treat it as such. Your feedback is important. We want to know what we can do better, what you would like to hear from us, and how you would like us to communicate with you. If you don’t want to hear from us, that’s fine – just let us know. We will act with integrity, transparency, and the highest standards of fundraising practice. We will always strive to reduce costs, and raise impact. Our Trustees and Volunteers are unpaid, and our Staff costs, office space, and resources are kindly gifted to us by McCarthy and Stone PLC, so that your money will go where it is needed most. Your data is safe with us. We never sell on your details, and we comply with data protection law. We strive for the highest possible standards in our fundraising, are registered with the Fundraising Regulator and are committed to complying with its Fundraising Promise. We are also a member of the Association of Charitable Foundations . We will only work with organisations that meet our high standards. We work collaboratively with all our partners and if we find cause for concern we will investigate as a matter of urgency. If you do not want to give, or wish to stop giving to us, we will respect your decision. We will never put pressure on you to make a donation. Whenever we start a conversation, either on the phone or in person, we will ask if you are happy to speak with us. We will be especially careful and sensitive when engaging with vulnerable people and have robust procedures and practice to ensure this. Any questions? Please get in touch – we would love to hear from you
