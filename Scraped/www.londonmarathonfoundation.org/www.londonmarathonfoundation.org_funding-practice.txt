Funding practice We are committed to being an open and trusting funder. We use our funding to inspire, encourage and champion participation and diversity in physical activity. What to expect from us and which initiatives we prioritise Across all aspects of our funding, we will be: Flexible: responding to changing needs and priorities Open: removing barriers to accessing our funding, trying new approaches and being transparent in what we do Trusting: empowering others, accepting risk and being proportionate in our requirements Inclusive: listening and involving target communities and audiences in our work Relational: putting building relationships at the heart of our funding. We’re a member of the Institute for Voluntary Action’s Flexible Funders initiative . We’re proud to be a signatory of the Funder Commitment on Climate Change . We recognise we can play a part in addressing the causes of climate change and supporting the organisations we fund in adapting to its effects. We want to create new opportunities for those who are less likely to be active. Currently, we’re prioritising initiatives that support children, young people and marginalised communities to lead active and healthy lives.
