News & Events Enjoy our selection of true stories 36 organisations awarded funding as part of Dementia Action Week… We are really pleased to share the list of organisation’s awarded funding as part of our Dementia Action Week funding programme. Thanks to the help of our supporters, we are supporting 36 different organisations across the country, with just under £30,000 of funding. As ever our programme was highly subscribed and unfortunately we don’t have the resources to help everyone who applied. However, we are very proud to have tripled our support for the Dementia Action Week programme since last year. This year we have a real variety, from long-established to newly formed dementia support groups, alongside signposting services like The Blue Book. Our funding will cover a wide range of activities, from trips out, refreshments, venue hire, or staff costs through to transport costs in rural areas. In many cases, these are very small organisations, often community groups, with an income under £10,000 p.a. so this funding will make a real impact and help ensure that these invaluable local resources can continue to open their doors to people living with dementia, their family and carers. We are very grateful to all of our supporters, whose kindness and generosity ensures that our programmes continue to flourish and channel valuable financial support to these brilliant local, community-led initiatives.
