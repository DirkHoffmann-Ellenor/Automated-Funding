We have always encouraged our grant recipients to send us information about their projects and the impact that our funds are making. This website provides examples of our recent grants, as well as case studies and information about the outcomes and achievements resulting from our funding. We are always keen to hear from grant recipients who would like to share news about their funded project on this website. The Trust is fortunate to have significant funds at its disposal, allowing it to make grants to deliver its vision; but it cannot do so without the dedicated and hard-working individuals who work at the coal face to help and empower disadvantaged people living at the margins of society. We remain inspired and grateful to our many grant recipients, who we see and value as our charitable partners.
