Types of organisations We want to fund work which addresses the challenges of local communities in areas of extreme deprivation. The list below gives examples of organisations and projects we fund, but we are always interested to hear about different projects which provide appropriate solutions to local problems. Our preference is for front line organisations working directly with people in need. We are unlikely to support campaigning, organisational development or capacity building. We will consider new work which is a logical extension of existing work, but do not support work which represents a significant shift away from your existing core aims and experience. We offer grants to Charitable and not-for profit organisations in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We do not fund Community Interest Companies (CICs). What We Don't Fund Community Centres Salary or running costs for community centres or village halls which offer a range of activities for all ages.
