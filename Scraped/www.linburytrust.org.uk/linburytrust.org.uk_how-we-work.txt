The Linbury Trust does not accept unsolicited enquiries or applications. We appreciate that a highly competitive open application process can be time consuming for the organisation applying. Through partnership work and research, we identify organisations we want to work with. We aim to be more conversational than transactional and we invite applications for projects we are interested in supporting. The Linbury Trust has a small and dedicated staff team, and our Trustees meet 4-5 times per year to take the final decisions on which projects to support. As part of our work in the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trust network, we are committed to addressing inequality through our grant making. You can read more about our approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion here: Diversity, equity and inclusion – The Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts (sfct.org.uk) . Another shared value is around environmental sustainability and more detail on this work can be found here: Sustainability – The Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts (sfct.org.uk) . The Linbury Trust is also a signatory to the Funder Commitment on Climate Change. Cymraeg
