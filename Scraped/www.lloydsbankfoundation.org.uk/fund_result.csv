Lloyds Bank Foundation's main funding programmes are currently closed, with no open application rounds. 2. The 'Specialist' and other recent programmes specify an annual income cap of £500,000, while ellenor Hospice's income is £8.2M, far above this threshold. 3. The Foundation focuses on 'small and local charities' and explicitly states its policy is to back 'underfunded voluntary organisations.' 4. No evidence of open or rolling funding for larger charities or hospices of ellenor's scale. 5. While the geographic scope and beneficiary focus are a strong match, the income restriction and closed status are explicit barriers. 6. Therefore, ellenor Hospice is not eligible for current Lloyds Bank Foundation funding opportunities.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:44:02,
