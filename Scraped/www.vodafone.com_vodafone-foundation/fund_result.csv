Must be a local initiative in one of the 16 Vodafone markets. No explicit exclusion of hospices, but focus is on digital skills/education.",Possibly Eligible,"The Vodafone Foundation is investing €20 million over five years to fund local digital skills and education initiatives in 16 Vodafone markets, including the UK. The funding is delivered in partnership with charities and NGOs, and the aim is to reach learners, those not in education, employment or training, and the elderly. While ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity and operates in Kent (within the UK scope), the funding focus is on digital skills and education, not directly on palliative care or hospice services. There are no explicit exclusions for hospices, but eligibility would depend on ellenor Hospice proposing a project that aligns with digital skills or education for their beneficiaries (e.g., digital inclusion for patients or families). Application status and deadlines are not specified. Overall, eligibility is 'Possibly Eligible' because the applicant type and geography match, but the beneficiary focus is only tangentially related unless a suitable digital skills/education project is proposed.",15,15,2025-10-15 13:12:02,
