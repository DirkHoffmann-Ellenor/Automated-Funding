Ellenor Hospice is based in Kent and serves Dartford, Gravesham, Swanley, and Bexley, which are outside the Trust's area of benefit. Previous grants have supported hospices and palliative care within Dorset, but not outside the defined area.",Not Eligible,"1. The Trust's area of benefit is strictly defined as Bournemouth, Christchurch, Poole, Purbeck, and East Dorset. Ellenor Hospice is based in Kent and serves areas outside this geographic scope. 2. The eligibility policy states: 'Your organisation must: either be located or have a base within our area of benefit, or deliver service within it (Bournemouth, Christchurch, Poole, Purbeck, or East Dorset).' 3. While the Trust funds registered charities and has previously supported palliative care and hospice services (e.g., Julia’s House in Dorset), all funded organisations are based in or deliver services within the specified Dorset area. 4. There is no indication that projects or services delivered solely in Kent would be eligible, and the restrictions explicitly state 'No funding for facilities outside of the Area of Benefit even where these may be used by persons residing within the Area.' 5. Therefore, Ellenor Hospice does not meet the core geographic eligibility requirement and is not eligible to apply.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:51:56,
