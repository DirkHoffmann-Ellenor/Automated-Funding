All projects must directly benefit social housing residents/communities. No evidence of regular/rolling open funding for health or hospice organisations unless the project is directly related to social housing issues.,Low Match,"ellenor Hospice is a registered charity providing palliative and end-of-life care in Kent, but Longleigh Foundation's project and research grants are only open during specific calls and are focused on initiatives that benefit social housing residents and communities. The foundation's main funding streams (project/research grants) require a direct link to social housing, and there are currently no open calls. While charitable organisations are eligible in principle, there is no indication that hospices or palliative care projects not directly tied to social housing would be prioritised or eligible. Individual grants are strictly for Stonewater residents. The only open example of a community fund was geographically restricted to the Black Country and focused on hate crime. Therefore, ellenor Hospice is a low match unless it can demonstrate a project directly benefiting social housing residents in line with Longleigh's priorities, and only when a relevant call is open.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:44:51,
