Tudor Trust is 'currently an invitation-only funder' and 'unable to consider unsolicited funding proposals' (www.tudortrust.org.uk_get-in-touch.txt, www.tudortrust.org.uk_our-funding.txt). 2. The new 'Change We Seek' strategy focuses exclusively on organisations advancing racial justice and systemic change, with recent grants made to groups working specifically in these areas (www.tudortrust.org.uk_our-funding_2025_change_we_seek_grants.txt, www.tudortrust.org.uk_what-we-do.txt). 3. While ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity and serves vulnerable people in Kent, there is no indication that hospices or palliative care organisations are a focus or have been funded under the new strategy. 4. The Trust explicitly states: 'If you are an organisation looking for funding please do not spend time preparing a funding proposal and sending this to us, as we are unable to take forward applications that reach us this way.' 5. No open or rolling application process exists; all new funding is by invitation only and targeted at organisations working on racial justice and systems change. Therefore, ellenor Hospice is not eligible to apply for new funding from the Tudor Trust at this time.",14,14,2025-10-15 13:11:31,
