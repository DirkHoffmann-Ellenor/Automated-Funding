Breathing Spaces Improving the experiences of parents and carers of children in hospital. The Breathing Spaces Fund for parent and carer rooms in hospitals was established by True Colours in 2018. It provided grants of up to Â£20,000 to any hospital in the UK which had a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit to improve a parent/carer room on a paediatric in-patient ward. We are delighted to have supported the development or refurbishment of 20 rooms across 18 UK hospitals. The rooms are designed to be non-clinical and comfortable, providing parents with a dedicated space away from their childâs bedside where they can have a cup of coffee, phone friends or family, or simply have a little breathing space. This short film describes the impact of parent/carer rooms in hospitals. We are very grateful to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and Kingâs College Hospital for allowing us to film in their new rooms. Bristol kitchen The Breathing Spaces programme was inspired by Lisa and Mike Spinksâ experiences with their son Rory. Lisa and Mike Spinksâ Story "Our son Rory was diagnosed with athymic complete DiGeorge syndrome in October 2013, which essentially means that he was born without a functioning immune system. As a result, we spent the best part of 3 years in and out of hospital, which included many long and difficult stays. Having a seriously ill child in hospital is one of the most stressful experiences a parent can go through and all of us respond in different ways to the pressures of hospital life but most of us, at some point feel lonely, frightened and far away from home and the support of our friends and family. We spent the majority of our time with Rory in his room day and night, which involved complicated rotas to ensure he was never left, that we both saw our other sons and that Mike could continue to work full time. Sometimes, we just needed a break: when Rory went to the operating theatre, we didnât want to wait by an empty bed but we were too nervous to leave the hospital; we had to have many difficult conversations with the medical staff and afterwards we needed to talk (or cry) and not in front of Rory; Rory was on TPN for the majority of his life which meant he was fed intravenously and as a result we never felt that comfortable eating in front of him; or sometimes we just wanted to connect with someone else who knew what we were going through â other parents. Unfortunately, sitting rooms/kitchens for parents or carers in hospitals are often given very little thought â it is the child who is sick after all. This is true of course, but as we parents play a vital role in our childâs care team so this needs to be seriously re-evaluated. If we look âafter the parents, then they are better fuelled physically and emotionally to look after their child so everyone benefits. Mike and I are determined to do what we can to make familiesâ experiences in hospital more bearable, to help parents develop friendships, share their experiences and give them the space they deserve." Lisa and Mike The Breathing Spaces fund closed in 2020. We have been absolutely thrilled to see the impact of the new rooms in hospitals and would encourage all hospitals to consider installing such a room on all paediatric in-patient wards. To support those seeking to develop new rooms, we have produced a suite of resources to provide inspiration and guidance. Please see below. Click to download.
