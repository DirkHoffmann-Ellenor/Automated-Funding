Open Call for Innovation The Open Call for Innovation allows innovative ideas to be proposed to Defence and Security stakeholders, even where a specific requirement has not been stipulated. It is a broad mechanism which allows innovators to present disruptive ideas which may otherwise be overlooked. The Open Call for Innovation consists of a number of competitions, including Innovation Focus Areas ( IFAs ), which run in cycles throughout the Calendar Year ( CY ). Further details of the cycles alongside the general requirements the Open Call are contained within the ‘Overarching Competition Document’ of the current cycle below. A full list of the planned cycle dates, can be viewed here . Closing Date Current Cycle 16 December 2025 Open Call for Innovation CY2025 - Cycle 4 For previous Open Call for Innovation cycles please see here . For past Innovation Focus Areas please see here . Themed Competitions Themed Competitions exist to offer suppliers the opportunity to submit proposals around specific government areas of interest. Themed competitions may only run for a short time and have set closing dates. DASA has had various themed competitions covering a range of topics. For details on past competitions, please see here. Themed Competitions currently open for application Closing Date Themed Competition Title 14 October 2025 Innovation in Support of Operations - Cycle 6 04 November 2025 Novel Technology for Intervening in Non-Compressible Haemorrhage 25 November 2025 PYRAMID for avionics and mission systems (Phase 2) Defence Innovation Loans Innovation Loans are an opportunity for UK-registered single small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) with solutions to defence themed problems to apply for a Defence Innovation Loan to help develop and convert their mature innovation into a viable business proposition. Defence Innovation Loans run in cycles throughout the year. For the current cycle closing date please see below, also for a full list of the planned cycle dates, please click here .

Market Exploration Market explorations enable us to determine solutions that already exist, novel solutions in development and areas that potentially require further investment. We do this by collecting information to better understand the current market capability in a specific area in order to stimulate the market and shape the focus of any follow-on activity. Please note that these requests for information do not form a commitment to subsequently launch a formal DASA competition. Please see examples of recent Market Explorations we have carried out here. Competitions in our pipeline Please note that this is not confirmation that these will launch. This is a list (not extensive) of potential upcoming challenge areas.
