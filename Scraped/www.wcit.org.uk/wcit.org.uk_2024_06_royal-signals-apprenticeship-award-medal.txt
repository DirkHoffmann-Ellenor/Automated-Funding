Royal Signals Apprenticeship Awards The Master was delighted to present the Royal Signals Apprenticeship award medals at Blandford Camp on Thursday 20 June. All the apprentices had worked incredibly hard during the year and the awards were a recognition of this. The British Army is a big supporter of workplace apprenticeships and all new soldiers recruited to the Royal Corps of Signals are enrolled in an appropriate course. The WCIT was also pleased to present a cheque to the overall ‘Apprentice of the Year’.
