October grants list Published by admin on 18 Dec 2023 At our October meeting, we were pleased to award £1,557,458 in new grants. As always, we have published the list of grants here and you can search the new grants using 360Giving’s Grantnav website here . We made grants in all of our themes except our grants to Kenya and Uganda. In this round, we were really pleased to award a number of unrestricted grants. This included funding to Jamie’s Farm, The Social Mobility Foundation, Family Links, and the Cranfield Trust. We also supported a few new charities to us, including Peer Power. Our next round of grants will be made in February 2024. Keep posted! Facebook Twitter Linkedin Pinterest
