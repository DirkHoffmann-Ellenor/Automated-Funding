National charities can apply only if the project benefits Herefordshire residents and there is a significant local presence.",Not Eligible,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity providing palliative and end-of-life care, which aligns with the applicant type and beneficiary focus supported by Herefordshire Community Foundation (HCF). However, the geographic scope is a critical barrier: HCF's grants are primarily for organisations based in or benefitting the communities of Herefordshire. The guidelines state, 'The majority of our funding is only open to those in Herefordshire but a couple of our Funds support projects in neighbouring counties or have a wider remit across England and Wales.' ellenor Hospice is based in Kent and serves Dartford, Gravesham, Swanley, and Bexley, with no indication of a base or service provision in Herefordshire. HCF gives priority to 'small, local organisations whose work benefits people in Herefordshire,' and national charities are only eligible if they have a significant local presence in Herefordshire. There is no evidence that ellenor Hospice meets this requirement. Therefore, despite matching on applicant type and beneficiary focus, the explicit geographic restriction excludes ellenor Hospice from eligibility.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:41:52,
