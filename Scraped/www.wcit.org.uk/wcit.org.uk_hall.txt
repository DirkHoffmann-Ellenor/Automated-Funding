Our Hall The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists is a modern Livery company with the Information Technologists’ Hall as its headquarters. Through the generosity of The Shirley Foundation, the Company purchased 39a Bartholomew Close (including 7 Bartholomew Place) for a million pounds in 1998 as its Hall (including the freehold). 20th September 2001 saw the official opening of the Hall by the Lord Mayor, who was welcomed by the Master, Sir Frederick Crawford, and Dame Stephanie Shirley CH. The door was ceremoniously opened by a great key, loaned by the Company’s Honorary Chaplain from the Priory church of St Bartholomew – a virtual opening as although the key was real, the matching keyhole did not exist. The ceremony continued upstairs, including the presentation of a wonderful pair of candelabra by the Mercers’ Company, and the unveiling of the bust of Dame Stephanie Shirley. The Hall is centrally located near to the Barbican, St Paul’s and Farringdon stations and is tucked away in the medieval alleys of old London with its links to the history and heritage of the City of London. As well as providing us with a permanent home and a base for our activities, the Hall is available to hire for seminars, small conferences, dinners and receptions. A variety of rooms allow for a flexible meeting place with modern facilities including Wi-Fi and air conditioning. The Livery Room & Treasures Area The Livery Room seats up to 38 people for formal lunches and dinners, and up to 55 for conferences and seminars. The room has a audiovisual screen and an induction loop for the hard of hearing, and offers wireless internet access. The Treasures and Reception Area is an ideal place for guests to relax and enjoy a drink. The Gold Room The Gold Room accommodates up to 12 people and has audiovisual.
