Charities with a national or multi-region reach are strongly preferred. Core and unrestricted funding is available. Applications from single-site or single-local-authority charities are extremely unlikely to succeed.,Low Match,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity providing palliative and end-of-life care in Kent (Dartford, Gravesham, Swanley, Bexley). The Dulverton Trust prioritises charities with national reach or those operating in at least two English regions; 'charities working from one site or within one Local Authority area are extremely unlikely to receive funding.' ellenor operates in a limited geographic area (Kent/London borders), not nationally or across multiple regions. While some of Dulverton's categories (General Welfare, support for families, older people, carers) could be tangentially relevant, the Trust's explicit prioritisation of national/multi-region reach and medium-sized charities (ellenor's income is above the preferred £200k-£3m range at £8.2m) are significant barriers. There are no explicit exclusions for hospices, but the geographic and size restrictions make ellenor a low match. Funding is available on a rolling basis, and the average grant size is suitable. However, the likelihood of success is very low due to the Trust's strong preference for national/multi-region operations and medium-sized organisations.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:36:50,
