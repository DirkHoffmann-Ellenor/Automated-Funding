Our areas of focus in the employability space include: Access to work, education and training, Mentoring, Direct financial support. We are currently undertaking a research project that will scope the landscape of employability to develop a clear understanding of the needs of charities and young people experiencing homelessness. This will create a strong evidence base for the programme. The research will also seek out best practice in employability, engaging with local charities and businesses (in real estate and beyond) to ensure that this initiative is as focussed and impactful as possible. LandAid’s Employability Fund will provide financial support to charity employability initiatives for young people experiencing homelessness. Through this grant stream, we will fund a range of emerging and existing employability initiatives, including seed-funding for emerging innovations across the country. This funding stream only strengthens LandAid’s ambition to provide young people with routes out of homelessness, providing pathways to paid employment and enabling them to transition towards living independently. LandAid will create two innovative, interactive Employability Toolkits – which will encompass a variety of resources, video content, and training sessions for young people and businesses alike.
