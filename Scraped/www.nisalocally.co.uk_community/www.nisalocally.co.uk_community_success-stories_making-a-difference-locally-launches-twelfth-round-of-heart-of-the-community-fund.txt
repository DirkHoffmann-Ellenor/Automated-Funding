Home Community Success Stories Making a Difference Locally launches twelfth round of Heart of the Community fund Making a Difference Locally launches twelfth round of Heart of the Community fund Making a Difference Locally (MADL), the charity of Co-op Wholesale, has launched the latest round of its Heart of the Community initiative, with £100,000 available to support local projects across the UK. Round 12 will prioritise causes at the heart of retailers’ communities, particularly those helping people through the colder months. Retailers supplied by Co-op Wholesale, including Nisa partners, are invited to nominate local causes to receive up to £2,000 in funding. From homelessness support and warm spaces to Christmas parties and pantomime trips, the fund is designed to provide comfort and joy to those who need it most. It also forms part of Co-op Wholesale’s wider social value strategy, which focuses on improving opportunity, wellbeing and resilience within communities. The retailer’s strategy has social mobility at its core, reflecting a commitment to tackling inequality and breaking down barriers. Co-op was the first retailer to publish a socio-economic pay gap report, and continues to champion fairness, inclusion and opportunity for all. The previous round of the initiative saw more than 50 causes benefit, with funding awarded to a diverse range of projects across the UK. These included Fit Mums Forest Project in East Yorkshire, which provides nature-based bereavement support for children; Next Step West Midlands, which empowers adults with disabilities through life skills and social inclusion; YMCA Neath, which offers warm meals and safe spaces for young people; and George’s Food Hub in Lincolnshire, which redistributes surplus supermarket food to families in need through “pay-as-you-feel” stations at schools. Other recipients included Warm Spaces Burton, Darwen food larder and The Peel Project, which provides support for ethnic minority women through befriending sessions and community kitchens. Since its creation, MADL has raised over £18 million for good causes across the UK, working closely with independent retailers to support initiatives that have a lasting impact. Kate Carroll, Social Value Lead at Co-op Wholesale, said: “This round of Heart of the Community is all about helping local causes that make a real difference in the heart of their communities. We’re proud to support retailers in bringing warmth and joy to their communities.” Facebook Link Twitter Link Pinterest Link LinkedIn Link
