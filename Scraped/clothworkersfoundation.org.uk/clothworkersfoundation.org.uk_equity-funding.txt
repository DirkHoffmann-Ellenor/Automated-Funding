Racial Equity grants â This Â£1.35 million initiative strategically supports Black and minoritised-led organisations with three-year unrestricted funding. The Racial Equity Programme sets out to strengthen lived experience-led organisations that we believe can make an impact on racial equity in our society. Working alongside our Learning Partners, we are intentionally building trust-based relationships, founded on deep knowledge of each organisation's strategic goals and supported through ongoing conversations about progress against these goals. The following organisations are part of our current Racial Equity portfolio (links open in a new tab): Action for Race Equality Baobab Foundation Do It Now Now The Ubele Initiative Ten Yearsâ Time and Liberating Knowledge are the Learning Partners to both The Foundation and our grantees.

As with the Racial Equity Programme, we intentionally considered organisations at different stages of strategic and financial development, and which are working in ways and spaces that are new to us (including campaigning, community-owned energy and community-led housing). The following organisations are part of our current Economic Equity portfolio (links open in a new tab): Set Them Up Foundation CIC (STUF) Breaking Barriers Repowering London People's Economy West Midlands Urban Community Homes (wMUCH) We will appoint a Learning Partner to support us and the grantholders over the life of the programme.
