Some funds may support specific issues (e.g., mental health, disability, elderly) or areas within Essex. Occasional support outside Essex is possible but not routine.",Low Match,"ellenor Hospice is a registered UK charity providing palliative and end-of-life care in Kent (Dartford, Gravesham, Swanley, Bexley), not Essex. ECF's funds are overwhelmingly focused on Essex-based organisations and beneficiaries, as stated: 'we can support a wide range of voluntary organisations, activities and projects across Essex, but we can also give support outside of the county or to specific charities if required.' However, this is described as rare and dependent on donor wishes. All grant examples and fundholder stories are Essex-focused, and there is no evidence of routine funding for Kent-based hospices. While ellenor Hospice matches on applicant type and beneficiary focus, the geographic scope is a significant barrier. Unless a specific donor-advised fund has a connection to ellenor or Kent, eligibility is very low. Next step: If ellenor has a strong link to an Essex-based donor or project, a direct enquiry could be made, but general eligibility is low.",15,15,2025-10-15 12:37:30,
